Mexico steel undercutting US industry (Russia?),wallstreetbets,apple,2,5,04-05-2024 15:17:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ck2nut/mexico_steel_undercutting_us_industry_russia/,"Newb here, story is below. Tell me how to make money on this, looking to short US steel industry. 

Commercial construction general contractor here. Just awarded a multi-million dollar job to a reputable Mexican fabricator. They undercut my favorite (and historically cheapest) guy by 38%, apples to apples. I‚Äôve been doing this for ten years, this has NEVER happened before. A few weeks before a friend/client called me to vet a bid he received from another GC (we did not bid the job), similar situation, different fabricator but Mexican. 

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ labor? Maybe, but not that much. We‚Äôre talking a delta of ~$1M. 

Then I see this: 

https://www.spglobal.com/commodityinsights/en/market-insights/latest-news/metals/031324-us-senators-introduce-bill-to-reimpose-25-tariff-on-mexican-steel-imports

What are the odds Mexico is undercutting by buying Russian steel? 

Either way, the US steel industry is about to get ROCKED if the tariff bill fails. Which, it probably will because congress is useless at this point.

Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon,wallstreetbets,apple,77,59,04-05-2024 12:38:01,https://i.redd.it/bsdb6qaymeyc1.jpeg,"Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. 

Earnings Marathon
Full Port Every Time - This is a Million Dollar Week!

Week 1:
Tesla - Calls
Meta - Puts
Google- Calls

Week 2:
MSTR: Puts
SMCI & AMD: Puts
Carvana: Calls
Apple: Calls

Week 3:
Monday after close / Tuesday before open
Palantir, Disney: 

Tuesday after close / Wednesday before open
Arista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: 

Wednesday after close / Thursday before open
Arm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:

Thursday after close / Friday before open
Mara, Soundhound:

These are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.

My Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, let‚Äôs get it!

April 29,2024

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/bernstein-says-be-like-buffett-and-buy-apple-shares-while-they-are-cheap-upgrades-to-outperform-.html

Bernstein upgraded shares of Apple
on Monday, saying they had fallen too far on fears of sluggish iPhone 15 sales and overall weak revenue in China. 

The firm, which has been on the sidelines for Apple with just a market perform rating for more than two years, advised investors to ‚Äúbe like Buffett‚Äù and scoop up the shares while they are cheap.

Bernstein upgraded Apple to outperform from market perform and kept its $195 price target, representing 15% upside from here. 

The stock is down 12% this year, compared to a 6.9% gain for the S&P 500, over fears that it is losing market share in China amid further restrictions by the government there.

Bernstein notes that following this year‚Äôs losses, Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 26.4 based on its 2024 earnings estimate and just 22.9 times its 2025 estimate. Bernstein displayed a table in the note to clients that shows Buffett tends to trim the shares when its price to earnings ratio gets above 30 and he buys more during quarters when the valuation is around the current range.

We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple‚Äôs China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,‚Äù stated the analyst.

 ‚ÄúWe further believe that replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle

Calling it very bullish.

And this.

And yet the put call open interest ratio for May 3,2024 contracts are at the 0.58 level or definitely bullish.

Calls it is ?

The decrease in China sales is already priced in the stock. So even if they mention a decline in China sales the stock could still bounce if guidance and earnings are good.

Narrow earnings beat, moderate to strong guidance because of the iPad refresh coming shortly after.

The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward 

2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward

"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024",wallstreetbets,apple,175,245,29-04-2024 04:05:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cfpv4o/9_reasons_why_apple_stock_will_fall_dramatically/,"9 reasons why Apple stock will fall dramatically after earnings on May 2,2024

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Will the ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù Exit Impact Apple Stock.

Why Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple."

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now

* Fall in phone sales especially in China
* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year.
* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.
* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)
* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)
* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense

However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.

Install Base & Great Product recognition

Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.

Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?

AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.

~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~

Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)

The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. 

As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.

Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.

Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.

All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.

Look for Apple to begin that story this June.

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,apple,218,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,apple,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

It's time to go balls deep in $XPEV - the Tesla of China (without the lay-offs). Here's the DD from an industry observer who knows the market and the desperation of foreign OEMs:

 üêâ  **CHINA IS BOUNCING BACK** üìà [PMI readings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/china-april-2024-caixin-manufacturing-pmi.html) released two weeks ago are looking bullish AF, and NEV sales [surged 80%](https://cnevpost.com/2024/04/03/china-mar-nev-retail-698000-preliminary-cpca/) MoM. Plus, GDP grew by a [healthy 5.3% in Q1](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/china-q1-gdp-growth-intl-hnk/index.html). The Chinese are gonna be all over XPEV like white on rice.

üöó **XPEV IS THE TECH KING** üëë These crafty fuckers [""borrowed""](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/elon-musk-says-chinese-rival-xpeng-stole-tesla-and-apple-codes-120112300398_1.html) Tesla's autopilot algorithms and gave them a facelift, 'cause that's how they roll in the land of the red dragon. Their L3 autopilot is already [available across China](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-expands-nationwide-coverage-xngp-china-market), and next year, it's going global. Elon, watch your six.

üåç **XPEV IS EXPANDING LIKE A MOFO** üöÄ They're spreading faster than herpes during the prom night. They've invaded the [UAE, Thailand, and Egypt](https://electrek.co/2024/02/22/xpeng-motors-global-expansion-announcing-dealer-partnerships-5-new-markets/), with their G6 SUV leading the charge. And if you thought ""[Like a G6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY)"" was just a catchy tune, think again - it's XPEV's battle cry for world domination. They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

ü§ù **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  üå≠  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech, they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy. VW can't sell their MEB Platform-based EVs in China without bleeding cash, so they're going all-in on [XPEV's engineering nectar](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/articles/ready-for-next-ev-push-volkswagen-enters-into-agreement-with-xpeng-for-fast-joint-development-of-two-smart-e-cars-18246). We're talking about a massive revenue stream and validation of their tech on a global scale, you autists.

üí∞ **BUDGET BRAND = MASSIVE TENDIES** üí∏ [XPEV is dropping a low-cost brand](https://cnevpost.com/event/xpeng-new-brand-debut/) that's gonna make their costs lower than your standards after a night of drinking. They're gonna be printing tendies faster than Jerome Powell can say ""transitory inflation.""

Now, here's the kicker - they've even got flying cars in the works. Yeah, you heard that right, the [Xpeng X2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-xpengs-drone-car-aeroht-voyager-x2-completes-low-altitude-flight-2024-03-08/). But I'm not even gonna elaborate, 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post, just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. üòâ

Remortgage your mum's apartment for this, 'cause it's time to get fucking PAID.

TL;DR: XPEV 4/19 and 4/26 calls. Literally can't go tits up. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods.

My prediction, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car, why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!! Buying a network/s would ensure 100% security methods being taken very seriously unlike our present system with telecom companies.

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside.

Here's my reasoning:

* In the lead-up to WWDC, I expect AAPL to trade more on news and speculation rather than fundamental business factors. For instance, reports of lackluster iPhone shipments in China are likely to disappoint investors again, potentially driving the stock price back down towards $168 or even lower.
* I also anticipate some profit-taking from investors who were waiting for this recent price increase to sell their shares.

While I believe the long-term fundamentals for Apple remain strong, and the stock will move significantly higher over the course of the year, I felt a 4% gain was a good enough opportunity to cash out for now. Investors who maintained a long position have little to worry about, but I think the stock may tread water a bit further before resuming its upward climb. Whether to cash out or stay invested depends on one's risk tolerance and investment time horizon."

**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

EDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns

EDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of

Hindsight Report, added the morning of 4/10 pre-market:

TSMC‚Äôs revenue report came in at 195k, a whopping 34% YoY increase from March of 2023, and a mere 8k short of my low-end prediction; however, the stock spiked very high just before the report was released, then fell off pretty quick shortly after the report was released, I imagine it experienced a little bit of a pump-and-dump over in the Taiwan market. This is most likely due to the report coming out after close in Taiwan. CPI came it at 0.1% over estimate and there was a big overreaction in pretty much every sector. Since this is such a small gap, I don‚Äôt think the dip will last long, and I am still bullish for earnings.

Short SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW),wallstreetbets,apple,20,25,05-04-2024 17:08:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwncjr/short_skywest_regional_airlines_skyw/,"Abstract:

Short SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW)

SkyWest stock has been on a tear for the past year, almost entirely because they used a decent amount of cash on their books to buy back an extremely large amount of shares in an unprecedented stock buyback. This stock buyback program will soon end, and SKYW stock will drop by \~50%.

Details:

SKYW announced in Winter 2022 that they were going to buy back $381 million worth of stock. However, at the time, the market cap. of SKYW was only \~$800 million, i.e. their buyback program was equal to almost 50% of their market cap and in the beginning, they were buying 10% of all shares traded for any given day. For comparison, this would be as if Apple announced a $1.3 trillion share buyback program. and was buying billions of dollars of shares a day. As such, this unprecedented buyback program sent the stock skyrocketing, far above a fair price, with a PE ratio of 80, for a non-growing airline, while other airlines have been roughly flat during this period (see the ETF $JETS)

  
However, that share buyback program is almost over. Considering that SKYW is now at an all time high, with oil prices as high as they are, once their buying pressure ceases in the near future I expect SKYW to drop such that it's overall performance over this time period will have mirrored other airlines, i.e. the share price will go back to the $20-$30 range compared to its current price of $70.

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.

Engineers at Apple have been exploring a mobile robot that can follow users around their homes, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the skunk-works project is private. The iPhone maker also has developed an advanced table-top home device that uses robotics to move a display around, they said.

Though the effort is still in the beginning stages ‚Äî and it‚Äôs unclear if the products will ultimately be released ‚Äî Apple is under growing pressure to find new sources of revenue. It scrapped an electric vehicle project in February, and a push into mixed-reality goggles is expected to take years to become a major moneymaker.

Yeah their car and streaming bets flopped, but the Apple bears counting them out are missing one thing - Cupertino is going back to its roots: kicking ass in computers and chips.

Just look at what they did with M1. Apple's silicon plays are insane. You really think they won't leverage that into servers and AI in a massive way?

The narrative is AAPL has lost its mojo. That's exactly when they strike. I've been loading the dip under $175. 

Mark my words:

* $210 by WWDC in June when they flex the new compute/AI roadmap
* $300 within 12 months as the AI server ramp kicks into higher gear

Don't underestimate Apple when they get lean and refocus on the core markets they dominated for decades. A $3T comeback arc is brewing.

Consensus is they are defending, but I suspect they will make a play for the DC dollars.  

Buying every dip."
