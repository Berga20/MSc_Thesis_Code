What do I do?",wallstreetbets,3M,688,1184,04-05-2024 16:54:31,https://i.redd.it/wlz0qdspwfyc1.jpeg,"A little backstory, a friend told me about options trading and they were doing very well (quadrupled their portfolio in a month). Looked like they were making money pretty easily, so I started to do the same and well‚Ä¶ I guess you could say it backfired nearly every time. Mostly of the spikes and drops were me going all in on SOFI, then I got screwed on Q1 earnings. I‚Äôm debating if I should just focus on buying stocks and focus mostly on dividend growth, or if there‚Äôs a way to shoot myself out of this 99% hole. "
3,My first time buying puts,wallstreetbets,3M,0,48,04-05-2024 13:18:14,https://i.redd.it/nc53qxn4ueyc1.jpeg,"this is my first time buying puts. I‚Äôm still trying to learn the process so I only spent $300 ( maybe a little too ambitious) it‚Äôs not going good so far, I bought four contracts of Carvana to go down to $94 by the 10th(bought on the 2nd) . Just here for ask a  question, should I sell it or wait to see it through. this is my first time with options so just wondering if i should close the contract or wait it out.

4,Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon,wallstreetbets,3M,157,123,04-05-2024 12:38:01,https://i.redd.it/bsdb6qaymeyc1.jpeg,"Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. 

Earnings Marathon
Full Port Every Time - This is a Million Dollar Week!

Week 1:
Tesla - Calls
Meta - Puts
Google- Calls

Week 2:
MSTR: Puts
SMCI & AMD: Puts
Carvana: Calls
Apple: Calls

Week 3:
Monday after close / Tuesday before open
Palantir, Disney: 

Tuesday after close / Wednesday before open
Arista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: 

Wednesday after close / Thursday before open
Arm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:

Thursday after close / Friday before open
Mara, Soundhound:

These are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.

My Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, let‚Äôs get it!

My account was at its lowest 8 days ago around $770 with like $200 in buying power since the other $570 was in a stock I wanted to hold - started with 3k last month and it‚Äôs been a slow burn since. 

Had jury duty the entire week before so I was frequently away from my phone with active trades, which caused me to bag-hold my DJT puts more than usual. I finally got fed up with the recent pump destroying my puts I sold my remaining contracts and went calls. That breathed some new life into my account and gave me extra breathing room for some QQQ and SPY plays in addition to DJT. Timing them well and taking profit at 30-40% to make gradual gains. 

Finally, I inversed what I read on this sub about Apple earnings yesterday and bought a couple OTM AAPL 175c as a meme to see if it would work. It did. $2300 gain today between my AAPL and SPY calls. I finally won!

( +400% ü•í ) ,wallstreetbets,3M,24,10,03-05-2024 00:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1civ9t7/smtc_paul_pickle_did_not_forget_about_the/,"Two months ago, I decided to write my first ever reddit post about my DD into a small underrated semiconductor company with a badass CEO named Mr. Pickle ü•í to see what peoples opinions on the future of the stock would be, specifically for the upcoming Q4'23 earnings report.   
  
**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

https://preview.redd.it/2t8w8lxqt3yc1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb83733453c9f2abaac5738615e35ea77939b3d

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology & data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

At a price of 146 GBp (I bought at 136) this stock yields 10% in dividends (14.6 GBp yearly). 

From shorttracker.co.uk I can see circa 6% of market cap is shorted, which gives me a signal of a further price increase when these positions are closed. 

Add to this a fantastic P/B ratio of 0.5.

I used to be on a 25% loss since I had invested at 170 ish some years ago. But I was fine with it given that the dividend yield was still 8% in an environment of 0% interest rate.

Last week I invested at 136 bring my average price down to 150ish. Still making a loss of a few % points but dividend payments cover that and I keep re-investing. 

Target prices from Bloomberg and Eikon range from 130 to 240.

Definitely a stock to keep on your radar in my opinion."

65,Coinbase will Moon after Q1 Earnings. (chart included),wallstreetbets,3M,22,39,30-04-2024 23:58:52,https://i.redd.it/32tct52sgpxc1.jpeg,"My grandma and your grandma were both talking about crypto while playing bridge at the senior home. With the launch of ETF, bitcoin went mainstream.

Rest written by AI:

Based on the graph you provided showing Exchange Normalized Trade Volume and the context of recent events, here's a bullish thesis for Coinbase regarding their upcoming Q1 earnings report:

### Coinbase Bull Thesis for Q1 Earnings Report

#### 1. **Increased Trading Volume and Revenue**
   - The graph indicates significant spikes in trading volume from January to March 2024. These periods of high trading volume are critical because they directly correlate with increased transaction fees, which are a primary revenue source for Coinbase. Given the substantial peaks, especially in February and March, Coinbase's revenue from trading fees is likely to have seen considerable growth in Q1.

#### 2. **Introduction of ETFs and Management Role**
   - The introduction of cryptocurrency-related ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) during this quarter, with Coinbase reportedly managing most of them, presents a significant growth opportunity. ETFs attract both retail and institutional investors, broadening Coinbase's customer base. Management of these ETFs not only generates management fees but also boosts trading volumes on the platform, further increasing transaction-based revenues.

#### 3. **Market Sentiment and Adoption**
   - The heightened activity and spikes in the normalized trade volume suggest increased market adoption and interest in cryptocurrencies. As a leading platform, Coinbase benefits from higher overall market sentiment, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. This trend is likely to have contributed positively to their Q1 earnings through expanded user growth and associated service fees.

#### 4. **Diversification and Innovation**
   - Coinbase has been diversifying its product offerings, including staking, custody services, and institutional investment solutions. These services contribute to a more stable revenue stream, balancing the volatility of transaction fees. The introduction and management of ETFs are part of this strategic diversification, likely enhancing the company's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.

#### 5. **Regulatory and Strategic Positioning**
   - Amidst increasing discussions around cryptocurrency regulations, Coinbase's proactive approach to compliance and its established position as a regulated entity in various jurisdictions could be seen as a competitive advantage. This positioning reassures investors and users, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs trustworthiness and user base, further impacting its Q1 performance positively.

#### 6. **Broader Economic Indicators**
   - The overall increase in digital asset trading volumes across various exchanges, as seen in the provided chart, suggests a robust period for the crypto market. As one of the leading exchanges, Coinbase is likely to have capitalized on this trend, enhancing its market share and revenue during this period.

### Conclusion
Coinbase's Q1 earnings are positioned to reflect a strong quarter, driven by increased trading volumes, the successful introduction and management of new ETF products, strategic market positioning, and a broadening of its financial services. Investors may look forward to a positive earnings report, underscoring the company's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment."

Now it‚Äôs time to transfer out the rest and put it in a HYSA (~5% will feel a bit insulting but the money is safer there). Lessons I‚Äôve learned - ignore the noise and stick to your plan. Take the base hits, meaning scale out at 20%, 30%, etc. and leave a couple runners once you‚Äôve taken most risk off the table. Market tide by UW is a pretty sweet feature. Use it to guide you, but don‚Äôt yolo based off of it. Same with flow in general. Find a strategy that works for you. If you like quick scalps on choppy days, go for it. If you prefer trend days, try to wait for a retest for a decent entry. Don‚Äôt be a shmuck because you‚Äôll end up blowing your account just to see an A+ setup that goes bonkers without you. If you‚Äôre ever unsure of what position to go for, take it as a sign to sit out. Patience is the name of the game and conviction goes a long way. Best of luck to you all.

I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

‚Äã

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia‚Äôs trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Adeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future."

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**International Recognition**

March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific‚Äôs #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.

Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

Many have lost their asses betting on a China rebound. Like, so many. WSB idiots: dead. Value investors: dead. Macroeconomists: dead. Currency speculators: dead. Commodities traders: dead. But here's why I'm different: I don't pretend to know anything. 

I don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.

I know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?

I also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?

What matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale. 

The shitty, wretched, Oliver Twist sad pussy orphan that is BABA will rise from the ashes like a goddamned phoenix and make us all rich. Why now, you ask? WHY RIGHT NOW? Again, people, seriously. I don't fucking know.

We have five of the Magnificent Seven reporting and big economic news:   

Monday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks & commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It‚Äôll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. 
 
Friday:  The Fed‚Äôs favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  

If your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA‚Äôs robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I‚Äôm staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.  Opinion only."

Current price $10.3
Target price $18.25
No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year‚Äôs earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company‚Äôs main expense (advertising). 

EA
Current Price $126
Target Price $148
Avg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS‚Ñ¢ College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  I‚Äôve been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  

RIVN
Current price $8.92
Target Price: $9.58+
This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells it‚Äôs trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA
Current price $150.6
Target Price $294
Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."
123,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,125,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

126,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,wallstreetbets,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,2242,434,15-04-2024 19:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4uddl/donald_trump_is_taking_his_of_djt_todays_resale/,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

\*\*Positions\*\*

128,ALCC/OKLO DD,wallstreetbets,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,45,58,13-04-2024 17:42:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c37inc/alccoklo_dd/,"I started looking into ALCC and Oklo this week after noticing the huge pump and dump this past week, and just thought I'd share some DD with you all.

Assuming that the merger closes without any ALCC public stockholders exercising the \~$10/share redemption right, the equity structure will probably look like this (from the amended S-4):

https://preview.redd.it/phe5mi8p4auc1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=5042d7131d540a850446c8b608dbc5c2d4b997f3

And post-merger, the combined financials will probably be similar to this:

https://preview.redd.it/amru6bau4auc1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=3993c76bfdabdfd3b7cbbb35a6661bc305b0cc14

Right now, pre-merger ALCC public stockholders' main asset is a \~$300M trust for potential redemptions ($10.41/share redemption price as of 12/31/2023).  Based on the equity structure above, after the merger and some dilutive options, ALCC public stockholders will only have a 17.6% share of the total $311 million in assets.  So what do ALCC stockholders get in return?  A piece of Oklo's future business... so what does that look like?

I don't know, and I'm not a finance person or someone in the energy industry, but i pretended to be and made a spreadsheet.  Also, I know stocks don't trade on fundamentals, but thought it might be helpful to think about it this way.



https://preview.redd.it/2a57btp48auc1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8a9c4b0a5bcbf1d4ab7d65ea556c7c4c460e50

NRC regulatory approval is the huge threshold question.  If Oklo gets approval, and their product is for real, this company could be huge.  If NRC says nope, then the investment probably goes to zero.

In the ""bet analysis"" part below, I calculated an Expected Value based on 25% odds of regulatory approval using a discounted cash flow method.  You'll see that this model assumes that Oklo becomes as big as CEG in about 20 years.

Lots of IFs for this stock, but I ended up buying 1,000 shares at $12.85 on Friday because I think that Biden or Trump will continue pushing nuclear energy, and eventually, Oklo will get its NRC approval.  Planning on buying another 1,000 if it gets close to $11 before the merger.  And then I'll just keep my fingers crossed that Oklo is for realo.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**

- ALCC's financial advisor (Ocean Tomo) did a discounted cash flow analysis of the merger.  Interesting read, and it goes into their financial model analysis of the deal (search for ""Aurora 15we Illustrative Unit Economics"" and start reading from there):  

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm)

- ALCC/sponsor shares are subject to various lockup periods subject to the stock price trading above $12/14/16 for 20 out of 60 consecutive trading days.  Oklo insider-owned shares are subject to lockup for 180 days past closing of the merger.

- SEC's new SPAC rules become effective July 1, 2024, so I'm thinking that the merger will happen in June so that ALCC doesn't become subject to the new disclosure requirements.

131,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,Alexandria Real Estate Equities,8720,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead."

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)).

Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù.

The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."

Ouch. See my original post for ‚Äòinvestment thesis.‚Äô
I‚Äôm still holding though, I didn‚Äôt full YOLO to 0dtes or weeklies on purpose here. Figured we might get some wild reaction like this. I think we see a rebound this week after earnings is digested and potentially getting more coverage.

Coming from my FinTech experience, this is what I really honed in on during the CNBC interview, when Sara asked about the tech platform:

Noto:
...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, we‚Äôre building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and we‚Äôre the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, we‚Äôre building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and we‚Äôre turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.

tl;dr yolo not looking so hot, but smooth brain still like stonk"

Where SPY and AMZN close on Tuesday will determine which way I'd expect AMZN's stock price to go. The call entry scenario is more likely given my [SPY narrative going to $470](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cftzj8/spy_470_path_prediction/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web3x&utm_name=web3xcss&utm_term=1&utm_content=share_button).  In either case, I think the ATH area of $189 is going to be the top for an extended sell down over the next several weeks. You can already see that we're trending towards the top of the 4hr RSI in the middle pane, which would indicate a reversal down is imminent."
148,$AMZN Earnings Tuesday,wallstreetbets,Amazon,79,80,29-04-2024 01:22:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cfmrhe/amzn_earnings_tuesday/,"I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:

# Continuing to Cut Costs

Amazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.

# AI Strategy

Amazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.

# Prime Day

Prime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.

# NBA Rights

Amazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.

# Investors Over Employees

Andy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.

# Summary / tl;dr

I'm a highly regarded individual and don't have numbers to back my thoughts up, but I know Amazon well. Earnings will show big profits and strong outlook. ~~I don't have any position yet but will update tomorrow, just planned this over the weekend. Hoping the stock falls a bit Monday, but regardless planning to buy some ITM 5/3 calls with a breakeven price around $183-185.~~

\[Edit\] see comments for my position, 5/3 call $177.50 3 contracts bought at 8.90/c."

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

Plus it looks like Tesla's FSD and no Anxiety and Quick Fill up for Ford might merge. Rumors about Ford in talks to license FSD would make Ford fleet business unstoppable. A driver that never gets tired installed in every Ford Fleet vehicle to supplement the tired groggy driver, or even replace him or her.

I don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.

I know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?

I also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?

What matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale. 

The shitty, wretched, Oliver Twist sad pussy orphan that is BABA will rise from the ashes like a goddamned phoenix and make us all rich. Why now, you ask? WHY RIGHT NOW? Again, people, seriously. I don't fucking know.

RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. 
 
Friday:  The Fed‚Äôs favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.  

If your looking for action - here it comes.  I think TSLA‚Äôs robo-taxi is science fiction- they are struggling with execution ie. Cyber truck. Inflation data will move the market if good or bad.  Is there another 5% down this week? Maybe, but I‚Äôm staying in.  I did buy some protective calls on SQQQ and SPY puts to hedge encase of downside.  Opinion only."

A series of unfortunate events began to happen. Taiwan was struck by an earthquake. I should‚Äôve sold then but the factory turned out to be fine.

Then a baldcel decided to crash the market because his order of Rogain from Amazon arrived late in the mail. I said to myself ‚Äúit‚Äôs okay I still got a few weeks left‚Äù

Later we got bad CPI or PPI? Numbers and the market dipped even further. At that point I was thinking of selling at a 50% loss but I said to myself 
‚ÄúThe monthly revenue should pump this stock up‚Äù

Then Iran decided to fire missiles upon Israel creating fear of a new world war. The market tanks again. I say to myself ‚Äúthere‚Äôs gonna be a run up and IV pump near earnings‚Äù

TSM has amazing earnings and good guidance. This is it, I can finally break even!!!!!

TSM dumps 5%

There you have it folks. A series of unfortunate events in the span of 6 weeks. What a ride has this been. Never saw a bit of green while holding these calls.

Current price $10.3
Target price $18.25
No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year‚Äôs earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company‚Äôs main expense (advertising). 

EA
Current Price $126
Target Price $148
Avg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS‚Ñ¢ College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  I‚Äôve been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  

RIVN
Current price $8.92
Target Price: $9.58+
This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells it‚Äôs trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA
Current price $150.6
Target Price $294
Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."
157,Will NVDA Bounce Back,wallstreetbets,Amazon,0,52,18-04-2024 14:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c74nbv/will_nvda_bounce_back/,"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead."

Rivian hasn't been doing well as a company since interest rate increases & the price of EV's drastically falling due to competition within their own used car markets and consumer skepticism about large EV and truck mile ranges.

Large institutions owned almost 90% of RIVN since IPO and r holding the bag on major losses. To regain cost basis they have been shorting Rivian into the ground.

Even though it was almost entirely held by institutions during IPO, somehow with only a 12% decrease in institutional ownership (some of the only shareholders) this accounted for almost a 70% decrease in price.

While I can only add one image, more than half of the put volume is still out of the money by a lot, and short interest for this stock is thru the roof at an all time high. if the stock were to rally 10-20% it could put these institutions in a very tough spot & I just don't see the end goal here.

They have a signed contract with Amazon set to deliver 100k delivery vans and the ceo is clear that they will be in an overall positive profit margin by Q42024. They have more assets to liability.

Which leaves me to 1 conclusion. These shak' quant analysts r shorting this stock for coke money.

162,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,wallstreetbets,Amazon,31,22,10-04-2024 16:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pinl/pools_closed_why_lesl_is_circling_the_drain/,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

Positions:   
Short the Stock
$5 puts expiring 11/15.

tl;dr: I'm terminally stupid, hate pools, and no one should listen to me."

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

&#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike‚Äîa direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies‚Äîhas marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:

>Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&#x200B;

The market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:

>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in ‚Äî benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran‚Äôs diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.

&#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&#x200B;

On Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers‚Äîthose who rely on oil prices.

So far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.

&#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war‚Äîor the potential of war‚Äîcan move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me."

And the EV downturn and Hybrid uptick can be Ford's strength. Ford beat: 49 cents to 43 est and 43 Bil to 40Bil est. Mostly from Ford Pro Part of the business, Revenue/Profit. 

(pssht, it was never about retail sales, it was always about FLEETS.) Hybrid vs ICE vs EV. Guess who's winning out, it ain't Tesla, or the EV fam. Go ask Hertz and their stock price about it. Long charging times and range anxiety has Hertz dumping their EV's like a bad time and temperature abused hamburger puke explusion :

how many gas stations in the U.S.? : 196,643¬†, source: https://www.xmap.ai/blog/gas-stations-in-united-states-of-america-everything-you-need-to-know#:\~:text=xMap's%20essential%20geospatial%20insight%20into,States%20of%20America%20(USA).

How many ice vehicles? : 265 Million, source: https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/fossil-fuels/gas-and-oil/new-registrations-of-gasoline-vehicles-are-still-growing-despite-the-ev-push/#:\~:text=But%20those%20numbers%20barely%20dent%20the%20288.5,were%20at%209.9%20million%20(3.4%20percent%20share).

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

Plus it looks like Tesla's FSD and no Anxiety and Quick Fill up for Ford might merge. Rumors about Ford in talks to license FSD would make Ford fleet business unstoppable. A driver that never gets tired installed in every Ford Fleet vehicle to supplement the tired groggy driver, or even replace him or her.

Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.
* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say ""wow, my savings are losing value""; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to. Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up. When you lose 25% of your purchasing power and live paycheck to paycheck, you are forced to adjust your lifestyle or take on incremental debt. 
   * Off the last bullet, [credit card debt is at an all time high](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-debt-record-high/), and [credit card delinquency is worst on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/credit-card-delinquency-rates-were-worst-on-record-in-fed-study?embedded-checkout=true). Here are some quick stats: 49% of credit card holders carry a balance month to month, credit card delinquencies have soared more than 50% in the past year, and 6.4% of all accounts are now 90 days past due, and the average credit card annual percentage rate is at a record 20.74%.

* [Basics like food are up multiples](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58350). No need to explain further, we have all been to the grocery store and felt this.
* Homes are completely unaffordable / [the cost of buying a home has hit an all time high](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1090/redfin-reports-buying-a-home-costs-more-than-ever-with), as such, home ownership is becoming less feasible and millennials / Gen Z are not building equity in what has historically been American's most valuable asset.
* [Child care is skyrocketing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-threat-that-high-childcare-costs-pose-to-the-us-economy-124248273.html). The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-22986/child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf-program) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income; however, that figure is roughly 24%. [Bank of America said the average childcare payment per household has risen over 30% since 2019 for its customers](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.html). We are at a point where some families are determining if they are better off to become a single income household versus a dual income household with child care.
* While the USD still remains the most dominant force (by a significant margin), regardless of opinion on sanctions, sanctions typically lead to weakening the USD. Further, nations are considering moving away from the USD more now than ever before. So much so that [political candidates are discussing potential penalties for nations that move away from the USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize?embedded-checkout=true). 
* [GDP missed estimates this morning at 1.6% versus estimates of 2.2%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/us-gdp-first-quarter-report).
* Finally, not to mention all of the chaos going on in the world right now. Conflict in Eastern Europe, conflict in the Middle East, the US border crisis, China & Taiwan, etc.

All the while, we are being told that everything is fine! There is nothing to worry about! This is the soft landing we have been looking for, and inflation is normalizing...right?

It's time to go balls deep in $XPEV - the Tesla of China (without the lay-offs). Here's the DD from an industry observer who knows the market and the desperation of foreign OEMs:

 üêâ  **CHINA IS BOUNCING BACK** üìà [PMI readings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/china-april-2024-caixin-manufacturing-pmi.html) released two weeks ago are looking bullish AF, and NEV sales [surged 80%](https://cnevpost.com/2024/04/03/china-mar-nev-retail-698000-preliminary-cpca/) MoM. Plus, GDP grew by a [healthy 5.3% in Q1](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/china-q1-gdp-growth-intl-hnk/index.html). The Chinese are gonna be all over XPEV like white on rice.

üöó **XPEV IS THE TECH KING** üëë These crafty fuckers [""borrowed""](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/elon-musk-says-chinese-rival-xpeng-stole-tesla-and-apple-codes-120112300398_1.html) Tesla's autopilot algorithms and gave them a facelift, 'cause that's how they roll in the land of the red dragon. Their L3 autopilot is already [available across China](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-expands-nationwide-coverage-xngp-china-market), and next year, it's going global. Elon, watch your six.

üåç **XPEV IS EXPANDING LIKE A MOFO** üöÄ They're spreading faster than herpes during the prom night. They've invaded the [UAE, Thailand, and Egypt](https://electrek.co/2024/02/22/xpeng-motors-global-expansion-announcing-dealer-partnerships-5-new-markets/), with their G6 SUV leading the charge. And if you thought ""[Like a G6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY)"" was just a catchy tune, think again - it's XPEV's battle cry for world domination. They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

ü§ù **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  üå≠  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech, they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy. VW can't sell their MEB Platform-based EVs in China without bleeding cash, so they're going all-in on [XPEV's engineering nectar](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/articles/ready-for-next-ev-push-volkswagen-enters-into-agreement-with-xpeng-for-fast-joint-development-of-two-smart-e-cars-18246). We're talking about a massive revenue stream and validation of their tech on a global scale, you autists.

üí∞ **BUDGET BRAND = MASSIVE TENDIES** üí∏ [XPEV is dropping a low-cost brand](https://cnevpost.com/event/xpeng-new-brand-debut/) that's gonna make their costs lower than your standards after a night of drinking. They're gonna be printing tendies faster than Jerome Powell can say ""transitory inflation.""

Now, here's the kicker - they've even got flying cars in the works. Yeah, you heard that right, the [Xpeng X2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-xpengs-drone-car-aeroht-voyager-x2-completes-low-altitude-flight-2024-03-08/). But I'm not even gonna elaborate, 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post, just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. üòâ

Remortgage your mum's apartment for this, 'cause it's time to get fucking PAID.

TL;DR: XPEV 4/19 and 4/26 calls. Literally can't go tits up. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       

We are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap‚Äôs are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.

I think it took a real rise because of the [WSJ article](https://archive.ph/A5WHE) back at the end of March about VST being an AI stock and this thing looks more like NVDA every day. I call it my poor man's NVDA. Maybe my fellow smooth brains might see it too? This Texas based integrated retail electricity and power generation company is just on a tear this year. It has a focus on low and no carbon emission generation. They are pushing the boundaries towards a sustainable future; not just doubling down on fossil fuels while green washing with a dabbling in renewables. Even though this has increased from $38 to $70 as of this writing, I still think it's a sleeper hit in your investment portfolio, especially with the AI boom printing money. AI data centers need energy like they need NVDA chips. All part of the shovels to gold miners metaphor.

**Risks and Considerations:** Undeniable growth doesn't mean undeniable rise in stock price. This is not financial advice and I have a bias to make this more popular. 

**Technical Analysis:** For what it's worth, the basic technicals are showing a slight pause and reversal to the 50 day SMA but still quite a bit above it. It's currently right in the middle of a Keltner channel but not below it enough to use the scalping tactic. So for any day trading or swing trading approach, I'd say just watch it for a better opening. Since this acts more like NVDA, then maybe waiting to jump in is just going to make it more expensive for you.

*My bias: I hold stock and have long call positions. I am long on 165 contracts @ $1 for 4/19 exp $75 calls which has a realistic possibility of the underlying going to $80 by expiration and being worth $66K profit. So, yeah I'd love nothing more than to see this rise. Today took a negative swing that might be a good opening as I opened 75% of my current position this morning as it took a major dump.* "

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, chair of the Zodiac Group, which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer, the owner of the Zodiac group, at $24 billion, making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war,‚Äù said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-miscalculation-retaliation.html


No direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?

Regardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran‚Äôs best interest to keep oil prices elevated."

How many ice vehicles? : 265 Million, source: https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/fossil-fuels/gas-and-oil/new-registrations-of-gasoline-vehicles-are-still-growing-despite-the-ev-push/#:\~:text=But%20those%20numbers%20barely%20dent%20the%20288.5,were%20at%209.9%20million%20(3.4%20percent%20share).

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

182,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,American Water Works,126,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

‚Äî-

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

In my theory a good economy is good for geopolitical tensions as the need for strife is much lower. Happier waters can lift all boats. 

As well, this means that we need to continue our economic growth. I don't know china's monetary policy at the moment but I think they are somewhat loose on their policy with lower rates than higher per se. Not an expert here. 

My question is does this increase the chance of rate cuts or decrease here in the US? 

My reason for it would be that with a China on the rise we must stay competitive and loosen policy. That plus the inflation that is now going to be coming in is from geopolitical pressures that will expeditiously make matters worse. How can you punish the American citizen double because of bad world actors? Tightening a loose policy is one thing. Higher gas at the pumps because Iran went off the rails is something else entirely.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

Why is that? is it because the globalists continue to repeat ad nauseum that water is not a human right? ya maybe.

Or is it because water is only part of what ECL does? did you know that they also immunize farm aminals against deadly diseases? I did mention it my last DD, but by that time I was so burnt out I couldn't continue on expanding how that will be immensely beneficial.

&#x200B;

A bird flu has been going on for longer than you think; believe it or not. Since my first ECL post actually. The CDC has already locked down the number of birds per square foot and all regulations that have been put in place are already here. What I am basically saying is that if you want to yolo on egg futures, it won't work out. Now... How does $ECL play into all this? well, as I said previously (read section 6 (it's quick) and come back), they immunize farm aminals.

But, just like ""Nalco"" is handling the water side, ""CID Lines"" is handling the livestock side.

You know, it's crazy to me how multibillionaires seem to know what will happen BEFORE it happens, and position themselves accordingly. Perhaps the fact that Bill Gates is super into genetic manipulation and advanced vaccines and viruses, that it's JUST a coincidence that he is ready for a plague that is about to disrupt your protein harder than sticking your nuts in a microwave?

I don't know. don't care. just want to make money. ECL still is the way. probably going to 260 easy.

Short SkyWest Regional Airlines ($SKYW)

SkyWest stock has been on a tear for the past year, almost entirely because they used a decent amount of cash on their books to buy back an extremely large amount of shares in an unprecedented stock buyback. This stock buyback program will soon end, and SKYW stock will drop by \~50%.

Details:

SKYW announced in Winter 2022 that they were going to buy back $381 million worth of stock. However, at the time, the market cap. of SKYW was only \~$800 million, i.e. their buyback program was equal to almost 50% of their market cap and in the beginning, they were buying 10% of all shares traded for any given day. For comparison, this would be as if Apple announced a $1.3 trillion share buyback program. and was buying billions of dollars of shares a day. As such, this unprecedented buyback program sent the stock skyrocketing, far above a fair price, with a PE ratio of 80, for a non-growing airline, while other airlines have been roughly flat during this period (see the ETF $JETS)

  
However, that share buyback program is almost over. Considering that SKYW is now at an all time high, with oil prices as high as they are, once their buying pressure ceases in the near future I expect SKYW to drop such that it's overall performance over this time period will have mirrored other airlines, i.e. the share price will go back to the $20-$30 range compared to its current price of $70.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So let‚Äôs look back a little to understand more.

This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches.

Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

The MACD on the 1 year timeframe began to form a second degree polynomial curve and was retracing the 61.8 Fibonacci level right Infront of my eyes. There was even a fair value gap on the 5 minute timeframe so according to SMC theory it is guaranteed to print a bullish engulfing harami candle and a subsequent elliot wave which will be the initiation of the bull run.

Furthermore I also noticed a nice 6 sided triangle forming an ascending channel with lower highs and higher lows, complimented with a breakout double bottom flag pattern in the 1 second timeframe resistance level which I have then cross-checked to the fixed range volume profile. After adding a few more exponential moving averages and a 9 period volume oscillator it had come to my attention that my ICT hypothesis was coming into fruition and thereafter I calculated that I'd get a return of at least 17500% minimum by session closing on Thursday the 32nd of June.

After seeing a break of the linear regression trendline structure, I went to the 12 hour timeframe to make sure the candle closed outside of the parabolic support area before placing my trade. I didn't see it there but I did see it on the 3 minute timeframe so that was good enough for me. As soon as the price crossed the upper range of the williams fractal index with an increase in order flow, everything had finally come together and the setup had presented itself nicely. I wasted no time and decided to sell most of my possession's and put it into this trade which I understand is a no no but I was sure this time. I position sized appropriately and went all in a market order at 143x leveraged hedged position going long with a 1:175 risk to reward ratio and a stoploss at the recent swing low.

While I waited for my order to hit my take profit and feeling optimistic about my position, I opened up a new tab in my browser and began customizing the brand new lamborghini I was about to order. It took me about 15 minutes to finish then I added to cart. Now that I was ready, I decided to take a quick look back on the progress only to find that my position had been liquidated. My only mistake was that the liquidation price was set above my stoploss so that was hit first. Actually the other mistake was that I went long when I should have gone short (avoid this). All of this has left me devastated and I have come to realize that trading just isn't possible and the only way to profit from this is by selling courses."

Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up.

210,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Arthur J. Gallagher & Co.,219,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

South Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity
Reuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00
April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.

The affected batches were sold in South Africa, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria, the statement added.

The recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday, which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.

Kenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup, which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

Gallagher & Co.,289,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

If this cancer trial comes out with positive results, the current market cap of 172.06 million dollars would be an egregious undervaluation.

In 2023, the anti cancer monoclonal drug KeyTruda *made $25 billion in sales*

Now if this CEO knows something we do not, then she must be screwing over investors who have been bagholding on this SPAC turd for the past 3 years by trying to go private right before some spicy announcements when the current stock price is in the fucking gutter.

This is a golden opportunity. Buy ME and either make it as expensive as possible for a management buy-out to happen, or failing at that, harvest the gains from cancer drug development.

1. Competition, other insolvent banks could shed light on their insolvency
2. New regulations intended to prevent bank failures
3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid

Here is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:

  
They lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. ""Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December¬†31, 2023, and December¬†31, 2022, respectively.""

On competition:

""The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.""

... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...

Regulation

""Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.""

... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...

Them a bank and don't have money

""We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

I don't want to start a panic. If this bank doesn't fail, we are a lot more fucked than we think we are because it absolutely should. My price target is $.0001. I have the ""courage"" to buy every put you write me at $2.5 so let's do this.

Sitting 160 $20 puts for 2 FOMC meetings out from now."
216,CROX earnings play....,wallstreetbets,AT&T,19,13,05-05-2024 11:12:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckow9i/crox_earnings_play/,"Recently, I've been scrolling through loads of Insta Reels featuring Crocs. Came across one where Crocs cars were cruising around town. You might wonder, what's the big deal? But there's some serious genius behind Crocs' social media game. They've got like 2 million followers on TikTok and Instagram, and their viral videos rack up millions of views. The younger crowd is all over Crocs and see see 'em as cool. But what really catches the public eye are those limited collab Crocs. Like, have you seen the Pringles Crocs? They're awesome if you ask me. I live in the Netherlands, and every time I've tried to get a limited edition pair, they're sold out within days. And they go for 70 euros, which definitely means some sweet margins for sure.

https://preview.redd.it/0rmn0u52kgyc1.jpg?width=615&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=f2e02d522ae85b9e75f35e2325b47b9b74bc35d3

Crocs as a brand is killing it, but their 2021 acquisition of Heydude isn't. Heydude's revenue is expected to take a hit, dropping by 22%, while Crocs' revenue is set to climb by 7%. Seeing the struggle, Crocs decided they needed to shake things up at Heydude and brought back Terence Reilly as Heydude's president and as Crocs' VP. Now, you might be wondering, who's this Reilly dude? Well, he's the brains behind those Stanley bottles that were hugely popular earlier this year. I've even seen videos of folks fighting it out over one bottle at Target. Reilly took Stanley's revenue from 70 million in 2020 to over 800 million in 2023, and now he's at Crocs. Seems like a long-term play, but I've got a feeling Crocs' guidance is gonna be solid with this guy onboard. 

Forbes even did a whole video about him, talking about why brands should be taking notes from his marketing masterclass: [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9IF7wBnus](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Sb9IF7wBnus)

But what does that mean for their financials? Well first of all Crocs is seriously undervalued compared to other big names in the footwear game. They're trading at a PE ratio of 9, while Skechers sits at 18 and PVH at 11. Crocs just soared 12% in their latest earnings report, thanks to record-breaking revenue and profit. The only thing was their guidance for next quarter, which came in a bit soft. They're expecting revenues to dip by 1.5%, mainly because of Heydude's revenue slump. But with that soft guidance, there's definitely potential for a surprise in store.

CROX is set to drop their earnings on May 7th before the market opens. The implied move is around 10%. I'm planning to dive into some call spreads worth 4k next monday and will put the details here."
217,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal‚Äôs Best Friend,wallstreetbets,AT&T,65,45,05-05-2024 03:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cki4bo/elf_an_inflationfatigued_gals_best_friend/,"Gather round, friends. We‚Äôre cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them.

Achieved 95% yields from the Gen 2 manufacturing equipment during Factory Acceptance Testing.

Enovix announced it has been granted 15-year Pioneer Status from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, MIDA, for manufacturing its batteries in Malaysia. Effectively this is a tax abatement. 

Site Acceptance Testing will be complete during 2Q24.

Minimum throughput for Gen 2 is 1350 units per hour is confirmed but they already tested at 1650 units per hour.

Signed a development agreement with a top 5 cellphone OEM.

Sampling to 6 of 8 top cellphone OEMS.

EX-1M w/ 18% more energy density vs graphite will ship 2Q24. EX-2M is expected to increase by 30% and will ship before year end 2024.

Anticipate further cost reductions of 35MM per year and Gen 2 cost will go down as more lines are added.

On the earnings call the Chief Financial Officer commented, they have a long runway before they‚Äôd need to raise capital and they wouldn‚Äôt do it at the current stock price. Nor would the board allow it.

He also mentioned they‚Äôve gotten unsolicited interest from governments and Sovereign Wealth Funds indicating a desire to provide funding if Enovix sets up a fab in their country. 

* Added info: this is a show me story that continues to de-risk as management continues to deliver. Despite that there is an intransigent short base that is approximately 30% of the float currently.

Background:
I‚Äôve been in Automotive Sales for 4+ years. 
I have been in sales, finance and insurances.

2020-2023: If you work in the business then you recall during this time you could not even buy a lot of cars from auction due to getting outbid by Carvana and Carmax. They would go 1000-1500 over retail book value which already sets them back if they want to have volume based pricing. 

Carvana stated they averaged $6432 per copy. Now either they are straight up committing forcible sodomy on way too many people or they are full of üí©. I‚Äôm leaning towards the üí©. 

The average dealership should run 3000 a copy split between the front and back. A great dealership will run 4000-4500 a copy between the front and back. The front gross is determined by the sale of the vehicle and the back gross is your finance and insurances. 

Here is the catch. Book data on cars is still rough. Buying cars from the auction is STILL rough. Dealers are still paying a fair share of money just to acquire used cars. Carmax who is the number one automotive group in the country didn‚Äôt even put those numbers up. Yet Carvana is magically the highest grossing store per unit in the entire country. 

I‚Äôm considering going into a short position because this has fraud written all over it.

**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

https://preview.redd.it/2t8w8lxqt3yc1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb83733453c9f2abaac5738615e35ea77939b3d

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology & data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

225,Snowflake isn't worth $50 Billion Dollars,wallstreetbets,AT&T,342,251,02-05-2024 21:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cirikp/snowflake_isnt_worth_50_billion_dollars/,"THESIS:
The issue with snowflake is that they‚Äôre a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework. 

However, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex ‚Äúdata science‚Äù tasks because most data needs to be ‚Äòengineered‚Äô before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.

This post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:

- Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose ‚Äòdistributed computing framework‚Äô or ‚Äòdistributed compute runtime‚Äô.
- Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to ‚Äòspark‚Äô in benchmarks
- Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data 
   - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial





THE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:

- ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlo‚Äôs Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~


- My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility
- Misleading promotional information for investors
- My (limited) experience using the product
- Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)

DISCLOSURE: 

- I‚Äôve held a long short position(<$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move. 
- FWIW, I don‚Äôt hold individual stocks; my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts. 
- I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.

MY CLAIMS: 

- Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers
- Snowflake‚Äôs valuation should be closer to Vercel‚Äôs, in $5 - $10 billion range.

If you‚Äôre ok with losing (and you will very likely lose) that much, why gamble at all. Use that money to buy more assets, not options.

If you can skyrocket that small amount, why not throw more money in the pit, up your leverage and make it big.

That‚Äôs why many people gamble with a small portion with their assets first, then YOLO at some point, lose it all and pretend to have quit gambling.

The only situation where ‚Äúlosing what you can afford‚Äù makes sense is entertainment. Like shooting beers or spending money on games, purely for entertaining. At lease you got something out of your affordable loss.

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/bernstein-says-be-like-buffett-and-buy-apple-shares-while-they-are-cheap-upgrades-to-outperform-.html

Bernstein upgraded shares of Apple
on Monday, saying they had fallen too far on fears of sluggish iPhone 15 sales and overall weak revenue in China. 

The firm, which has been on the sidelines for Apple with just a market perform rating for more than two years, advised investors to ‚Äúbe like Buffett‚Äù and scoop up the shares while they are cheap.

Bernstein upgraded Apple to outperform from market perform and kept its $195 price target, representing 15% upside from here. 

The stock is down 12% this year, compared to a 6.9% gain for the S&P 500, over fears that it is losing market share in China amid further restrictions by the government there.

Bernstein notes that following this year‚Äôs losses, Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 26.4 based on its 2024 earnings estimate and just 22.9 times its 2025 estimate. Bernstein displayed a table in the note to clients that shows Buffett tends to trim the shares when its price to earnings ratio gets above 30 and he buys more during quarters when the valuation is around the current range.

We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple‚Äôs China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,‚Äù stated the analyst.

 ‚ÄúWe further believe that replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle

Calling it very bullish.

So recently to save the bank from failing shareholder got diluted 70%+ with more dilution on the horizon via warrants. That dilution itself would be sufficient explanation for its current price. Instead they posted an all time terrible 4q2023 earnings. 

Well 1q2024 is in and it‚Äôs bad. Excluding write downs losses accelerated from 187 million to 327 million q/q or a jump of 75%. I guess all of that dilution saves you so eps is only a loss of 45c share.  Worst of all that‚Äôs a loss of 45c per share after selling their best loans meaning losses next quarter are almost guaranteed to be worse. Net interest income down 16% q/q. Net interest margin down 54 basis points q/q (that‚Äôs a 20% NIM drop in a single quarter). 27% Revenue drop q/q and 76.2% drop y/y.   Non interest income went from 127M last quarter to 9M this quarter. Non performing loans jumped 86.5% q/q. Allowance for credit losses jumped 21% q/q.

Overall these are terrible numbers but to have this bad of a q/q results after an all time bad quarter is scary so they need to show those losses decelerating very soon otherwise anymore capital flight and they could go under. I don‚Äôt personally expect them to fail but if you have shares I‚Äôd use any low volume pre market pump to get out. This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze opportunity and they just proved the road to meeting even yesterday‚Äôs valuation is probably over 2 years away. Be wary I‚Äôve seen plenty of big pops on earnings before the market opens evaporate when real investors start selling at open.

Edit: One last thought. It to me feels shady that they really rushed this earnings (13 hour notice) into the morning of an fomc meeting. This is most likely because many regionals used the most rosy legally allowable prediction of two rate cuts in their 2024 forward looking statements and I‚Äôm sure Otting wanted to do the same instead of waiting a week or 2 and having to be only able to factor in one or zero.

This is called the ‚ÄúJapan Carry Trade‚Äù.

-Google it for source. Or, go to the more intelligent Reddit forum, r/economics

Japan only lets others loan a firm 20:1 margin, and that‚Äôs based on how much they own in your treasury bonds.

Guess what? 20 Trillion comes from the fact that Japan holds around 1 Trillion in US Treasury bonds. If the Yen tips further up, or the interest rate spread between the two tightens in its yield‚Ä¶guess who‚Äôs callin‚Äô?

Marge. Marge is callin‚Äô. Auntie Marge‚Äôin‚ÄôCawl.

What could possibly go wrong! 

Maybe, the Yen going Incredible Hulk. And Yen going Hulk, means you have to pay more money than you expected, to buy back the Yen. So if Yen increases a bunch, Stock Market crashes. Global financial crisis. Or, if the US stock market starts to crash enough, MARGIN CALL. Stock market crashes more.

Supposedly, if oil tips up, since the US isn‚Äôt in BRICs anymore, that too will affect the Yen.

All you need to realllly know, is a black swan is on the horizon. JPOW may be able to avoid it with bribery‚Ä¶but if NOT, market will crash bigly.

Chicago Bears case:
1. General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance
2. Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US

Chicago Bulls case:
1. Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year
2. Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats
3. The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. 
4. Shorts can‚Äôt help themselves trying to call crash

My positions:
Jan2025 1000c
May 24 950c

The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. 
We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. 

A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. 

The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: 

The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull‚Äôs best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. 

Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. 

The psychology of us ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more.

Good luck everyone! Don‚Äôt do anything impulsive or regarded and please add your disrespectful bear and bull thoughts in the comments. "

241,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,AT&T,265,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."

While the mouse ears is great at screwing bears over, my sound bullet proof reasoning is below:

- they just secured a proxy ‚Äúvictory‚Äù which is anything but to me. It shows blood in the water and hostility, not to mention doubt that their current leadership can actually power through and make them the blue chip they once were.

- they have had an awful run at the box office lately. While I think the FUTURE releases of movies bodes well for them longer term, I see this as a very reasonable and logical place for Wall Street to knock them down a rung without giving too much value into forward movie guidance.

- Bob Iger is a gap filler IMO. I don‚Äôt know how any long term shareholder of this company for the last 5 years could be excited compared to the rest of the market.

- they throttled way up last earnings. In line with other stocks it seems like a balance of once blessed and once cursed, which will happen when they enter ER. 

- IV will continue to increase leading up to earnings, which will help all contracts in value.

- I expect this week to be a red week and not pushing 52W H, so I would like to see DIS move to $105 by EOW ideally. Oh yeah FOMC this week too!

The play:

$105p 5/10 exp. Available for a cool $1 or so with great opportunity to not only be ITM prior to earnings but also along with the kick in IV to see a nice 60-200% increase in value without even playing the ER call.

My position: will comment Monday AM when I secure position.

My exit: if I double by EOW I will sell at least half and let the rest ride.

Prediction: $DIS to $93 by 5/10, probably 5/9. If my prediction is correct, it will make those $105 puts be worth well more than 10x what they are now.

Best of luck!"
244,Avis Budget Payless ($CAR) is fucked,wallstreetbets,AT&T,69,74,27-04-2024 11:56:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cect4s/avis_budget_payless_car_is_fucked/,"Hertz/Dollar shit the bed because of their horrid decision to replace most of their fleet with electric cars that nobody wants to rent, however that is not the only thing that killed Hertz. Enterprise/Alamo/National (which is, unfortunately, privately held) has undercut the rental market by having the cheapest rates for business customers. I‚Äôve noticed that a lot of my regular customers (usually on business trips) have been renting from Enterprise lately and Avis has lost a significant portion of our portfolio. 

Not to mention Enterprise has significantly increased their fleet (at least on the east coast), and have slowly taken over this location‚Äôs marketshare, although I can only speak for where I work. 

I believe that earnings for CAR do not look good and the premiums on puts seem to agree with me. I would like to hear some counter arguments as to why $CAR won‚Äôt fall on its face this earnings. 

I currently don‚Äôt hold any positions at the moment because I lost all my money following you regards, but if it looks truly bad for $CAR I might work some extra shifts behind the Wendy‚Äôs dumpster.

All cool things do come back, and in this case it‚Äôs the H5N1 or bird flu virus. Take a few minutes to google H5N1 and you‚Äôll see growing concerns over the worldwide spread, including in the US, where it has now spread into the dairy supply. While the virus so far has not jumped much to humans, the known fatality rate is 50%, and it has been confirmed in some dairy workers so far in Texas. Many experts are worried, and it could be a great opportunity for you to be on the right side of a leap. ([massive amount of vaccines would be needed](https://www.statnews.com/2024/04/24/h5n1-bird-flu-vaccine-preparedness/)preparedness/) 

Good news however, as H5N1 vaccines do exist, and the US has some stockpiled, but not nearly enough for what the need would be. GSK (Glaxo Smith Kline) and AZN (Astrazeneca) both have approved H5N1 vaccines between US/ EU.

My plays 
GSK $65c 1/21/26 (bought at .25, is now .8)
AZN $100c 1/17/25 (bought .36 is now .39)
AZN $110c 1/17/25 (bought .12 is now .19)

246,"For you weak paperhands, who actually managed to lose money this week, CPNG may be your last chance",wallstreetbets,AT&T,15,38,26-04-2024 22:44:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdyxbo/for_you_weak_paperhands_who_actually_managed_to/,"So after 6 straight days of red, and caving into your FOMO self, you chose **this** week to be a bear?

Look, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I‚Äôll let you in on some of my cooking üç≥

Okay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.

For all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. üí∞x10

The fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. üåï üöÄ

For the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. üß†üí°

Let‚Äôs Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:

I‚Äôm not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

https://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20

**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b

Next is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.

\*\*Terminal Value (TV)\*\*= FCF2033 √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r ‚Äì g) = US$3.7b√ó (1 + 2.3%) √∑ (7.1%‚Äì 2.3%) = US$79b

\*\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\*\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b√∑ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b

Crunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billionüí∞üí∞üí∞

Now, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.

Compared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! üìà

Now, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don‚Äôt make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.

So, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.

TLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy‚Äôs while the rest of us count our tendies üí∞üçü

Many have lost their asses betting on a China rebound. Like, so many. WSB idiots: dead. Value investors: dead. Macroeconomists: dead. Currency speculators: dead. Commodities traders: dead. But here's why I'm different: I don't pretend to know anything. 

I don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.

I know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price. Will it do this, through the largest dividend and/or share buyback the world has ever seen? FUCK NO. Would their government disappear all the executives if it tried? I don't know, probably. Who cares?

I also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?

What matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale. 

The shitty, wretched, Oliver Twist sad pussy orphan that is BABA will rise from the ashes like a goddamned phoenix and make us all rich. Why now, you ask? WHY RIGHT NOW? Again, people, seriously. I don't fucking know.

While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020.

* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated).

Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up.

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

Whether Microsoft‚Äôs earnings beat, or fall short, there is a very high likelihood that further details will be provided on their security breach this quarter. 

With the current market‚Äôs shift in sentiment towards geopolitical risk, any additional updates on this breach may serve as justification for an exit for large firms. 

This security breach didn‚Äôt take much air out of the rally at the beginning of the year, but current general market sentiment may take this and run it down.

1. **Capital Expenditures** - Meta is ramping up its investment in AI, raising its 2024 spending forecast to $35 billion to $40 billion, up from $30 billion to $37 billion. They're betting big on future tech.

2. **Revenue Forecast** - For Q2, Meta expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint, $37.75 billion, represents an 18% year-over-year increase, though it's slightly below the average analyst estimate of $38.3 billion.

Here‚Äôs the thing on IV crush - it will always beat at least one side to a pulp. META moves 10% up, puts get hammered. 10% down and calls see life savings go to $0. Moves 2-3% BOTH sides suffer.

So why not play $SNAP instead? 

Benefit is you still have high IV leading into their ER, their stock price will follow META‚Äôs news and you can close out before you face the subsequent crush of IV on Friday morning.

TL/DR: I think META crushes earnings, SNAP soars in AH before their ER, calls for easy money."

1. I believe humanoid robots will be one of the most important technology of this decade and Tesla is at the forefront. Tesla is the only company (other than Hyundai probably) that has mass production experience and technology to make humanoid robots. Good engineers still prefer to work at Tesla than other manufacturing companies. For example, last time I checked around 2023, most of the PhD students from top robotics lab at UCLA went on to work at Tesla. The AI development for robots will probably be easier than robotaxi because there is much larger margin of error (not moving at 100mph, mostly controlled environment). If they announce something like ‚Äúcommercial robots at factories 202X and at homes 202(X+P) for $Y0,000,‚Äù the stock price can go $300s.
2. Tesla is considered to be very interest rate sensitive. There was a lot of fear that US inflation just will not come down (some even suggesting that the Fed will raise rates). But PMI result that came out yesterday morning was much better for inflation than expected. Tesla stock can pop with rate cut.

  
I agree with bears (and have been Tesla bear) that much of the stock price already priced in Tesla‚Äôs dreams. However, even if none of their dreams come true, Tesla will probably be $120 around 2026 where as the upside is massive.

P.S. With that said, I have following bearish points just to summarize my thoughts.

1. EV is inferior product for consumer experience compared to ICE for most people unless autonomous driving or solid-state battery become available. People make analogy of ICE-to-EV to 2G-to-smartphone but I wonder if these people actually have ever been on road trips with EV.
2. Robotaxi with vision-only might never happen. The AI issue of robotaxi is very different from generative AI as generative AI is almost expected to be wrong much of the times whereas robotaxi cannot be wrong ever. It is a tail-end, rare-event problem. People assume that Tesla will be the only one to solve robotaxi because they have more data than others, but I can make petabytes of data by copy-pasting some videos. What is important is the ability to reliably deal with long-tail problems, which might just require additional sensors. In that case, Tesla already sold FSD with promise of vision-only L4-5 technology. Are they going to recall them to add LIDARS? With that said, I am not expert in this field and have been wrong about capabilities of AI (didn‚Äôt expect a language model like ChatGPT happening so fast) so I could be wrong.
3. Many people price in SpaceX and Neural link into Tesla. As far as I know, these are separate companies."

257,"Let's discuss Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, $FNMA and $FMCC",wallstreetbets,AT&T,15,13,23-04-2024 23:09:30,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cbiz4c/lets_discuss_fannie_mae_and_freddie_mac_fnma_and/,"I have no idea what I am doing, but maybe somebody smarter than me  can do something with this information. I am also too regarded to input  images. This is my first post ever. Please be gentle fellow regards. **THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PLAY. Only shares atm.** 

Do you remember the housing market crash in 2008? Me neither! Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship through the FHFA since September 2008. [This article](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2)  written in 2022 is part 2 of a well written future outlook for the two  mortgage lending giants that were on the front lines during the 2008  housing crash. As I understand it, in order for the two companies to  escape from the conservatorship, they must first raise enough capital to  IPO, which is a massive undertaking. However, things are slowly looking  up. In 2019 the Trump administration authorized the two companies to  start building capital again by accruing retained earnings. Their  combined equity is cresting 100 billion. [It is thought that for both companies to IPO, a combined 150 billion dollars in capital would be required](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2),  which is thought to be massive for an IPO. I believe these two  companies are in for massive gains in the upcoming years as they  continue to rebuild their coffers and potentially exit conservatorship.

  

But don't take my  word for it. Do a one year chart comparison of  the two companies (I would have included that, but I am so god damn  regarded). You might notice that things started to pick up around August  of 2023. I did some digging to find out what was going on around that  time, and lo and behold, [a  federal jury ruled in favor $FMCC and $FNMA, stating that the sweeping  of all their profits into the US treasury due to an amended stock  purchase agreement in 2012 was unconstitutional.](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/bsf-prevails-at-trial-in-decade-long-battle-against-fhfa.html) 

&#x200B;

These two companies are in control of \~**7 trillion dollars worth of assets (**[$FNMA](https://companiesmarketcap.com/fannie-mae/total-assets/#google_vignette) [$FMCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090423A)) combined. I have no idea what that means, but those are pretty big  numbers right? Too big to fail, in fact? One might think....   

With the housing market going crazy, [and a potential Trump win which would be highly favorable for FNMA and FMCC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/a-trump-reelection-seen-as-bullish-for-fannie-freddie-shares),  these are two stocks that I think we should all have our eyes on, as  they seem fairly undervalued at the moment. People have forgotten about  them, and they shouldn't.   

[Here is an excellent interview transcript from the CEO of Fannie Mae, Priscilla Almodovar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceo-fannie-mae-believes-100000781.html).  She is a relatively new CEO (2022 instated) as is the CEO of Freddie  Mac for that matter. She speaks very optimistically about the road ahead  for FNMA, and discusses the lessons learned over the past 15 years. [There](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/fannie-mae-ceo-discusses-government-conservatorship-of-gse) [are](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230137-anticipation-grows-for-end-of-gse-conservatorship?v=preview) [so many god damn](https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/Fannie_Mae_Envisions_Independence_from_Government_Control.aspx) [paywalled  articles from this year or last year in which the CEO and important  people are talking about the end of conservatorship](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230116-the-gses-have-been-profitable-since-2012-maybe-its-time-to-end-the-conservatorships?v=preview). So annoying.   

Options are not available for these two companies (maybe that has  something to do with the conservatorship, I have no idea), but the  shares I believe are extremely undervalued for what they could become  down the road. Please don't take this as advice.   

I have $2000 invested in both $FNMA and $FMCC for a total of $4000  because that's what I can afford right now. I would share a picture, but  the insert image button is not working.  "

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So let‚Äôs look back a little to understand more.

Tuesday,March 26,2024

https://www.cnbc.com/amp/2024/03/26/trump-media-stock-ticker-djt-debuts-after-dwac-merger.html
 
This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

You cash out too soon and you miss out on those sweet-sweet tendies. You cash out too late and you‚Äôre filling out an application at Wendy‚Äôs. 

What we saw today was a major shift in sentiment among market makers. What should‚Äôve been a rebound off of the good news that neither Iran or Israel actually tried to inflict damage on one another, resulted in a steady crash across the market, with more markets makers net short than long for the first time in months. 

It‚Äôs only retail investors left who are net long than short and the MM‚Äôs are going to capitalize on this to profit off of us.

Given that earnings season is coming up (currently there is a black out period for orgs where they cannot participate in stock buy backs), there will be a boost driven by companies buying stock in the coming weeks before a sharp decline driven by market makers selling off to retail investors (as they have historically done during high interest rate environments).

Furthermore we see the elevated VIX indicating high volatility which has resulted in market makers reducing every rally we see, and the stocks continuing to drop.

With no interest rates coming this year, MM‚Äôs will continue to sell and short as most companies will fail to grow in a high interest rate environment due to cutbacks.

Only then will be see layoffs that will finally trigger the fed to cut rates. It presently won‚Äôt happen given that there just isn‚Äôt enough capital leaving circulation, and congress quite frankly does not want to do anything about it in the way of taxing it out of the bloated economy.

Hedge funds will act rationally and continue to net sell this year, reducing shareholder value, until they see a reason not to. It‚Äôs up to us to either sell, hedge, or get slaughtered in the process. The choice is yours.

During the depression phase, it‚Äôs the complete opposite: the S&P 500 has sold off for 6 straight days, while many individual stocks e.g. Dave & Buster‚Äôs (PLAY) is down 12 days in a row, and Overstock/Beyond (BYON) has only had 1 green day w/minuscule gain in April thus far, following a 13-day losing streak.

It‚Äôs not just a matter of very high & very low RSI readings, but once the algos identify a trend, they seem to blindly follow it and squeeze out every last penny until they can‚Äôt anymore.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble, ie \~1995‚Äì2002, and to my surprise, this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive, but every few days, the trend would reverse. 

For example, Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3%, 4%, 1%, 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21, 1999, then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up, and on the way down, as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day, algo-driven markets."

The market has done about 12-15% per year for the past 10 on average.",wallstreetbets,AT&T,391,149,19-04-2024 12:45:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c7w062/the_historic_normal_return_of_the_stock_market_is/,"The fact that so many people are posting asking why the market is down 5% from the highs it hit this year
prompted me to take a minute to explain. 

This is what you call ""mean reversion"".
If you flip a coin 100 times and it falls heads 100% of the time, it's still a 50-50 chance on the next flip to be either-or.

But if you flip that coin an infinite amount of times, it will be closer and closer to 50/50 with sometimes landing on the side.

If your expected average on the stock market is 8%, it doesn't mean that it will be a flat 8% return. Some years it'll be up, and some, it'll be down.

It can even have decades above or below that.

In the short-term, sentiment matters a lot, but in the long-run, fundamentals are all that really matters.

If earnings grow at a pace that justifies the increase in prices, the market will hold, but at some point they won't.

TLDR: Don't panic, this is normal. There's always a way to make money, just figure out where the flows are going.

273,PARA Thesis - No Deal and No Merger Outlook,wallstreetbets,AT&T,21,21,18-04-2024 21:08:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c7ep3z/para_thesis_no_deal_and_no_merger_outlook/,"This thesis builds on continued earnings growth from Q3 and Q4 of 2023. I am anticipating EPS of between $0.75 and $1.00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024. I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect, Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x, while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions, I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line, a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I‚Äôm fairly confident the Skydance deal won‚Äôt be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this,

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall, bullish on Paramount. I think it‚Äôs trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects, David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He‚Äôs also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised, but in my opinion, if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues, would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two, the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall, I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense. It‚Äôs a dramatic story if you have been paying attention. "

No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.

Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.

This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.

Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).

Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."
276,Will NVDA Bounce Back,wallstreetbets,AT&T,0,52,18-04-2024 14:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c74nbv/will_nvda_bounce_back/,"

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead."
277,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,AT&T,197,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

278,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,AT&T,128,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

279,Tesla : Should Investors Approve Musk‚Äôs $56 Billion Pay Again ?,wallstreetbets,AT&T,8,140,17-04-2024 14:50:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6btrt/tesla_should_investors_approve_musks_56_billion/,"Background as I know: a shareholder brought a lawsuit in Delaware court disputing Musk‚Äôs $56B (yes 56 billion dollars) compensation package. The court decided in favor of the shareholder and voided Musk‚Äôs pay package. 
Now, Tesla is asking shareholders to approve his $56 B pay package again!

With the mess going on at Tesla and stock tanking non-stop, should shareholder approve the $56 B pay package? This is more than 10% of Tesla‚Äôs current market value !!!

As for the original pay package of $56B, that was approved by Tesla board, which is basically owned by the boss himself. Basically, the package was approved for Elon by himself.

IMO, shareholders shouldn‚Äôt approve this high package.

280,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,AT&T,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

So here is the thing. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto, and it made me realize 2 things 

1. After the bitcoin halving, which btw is meant to be on 4/20, the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold. This, for the highly regarded, means it‚Äôs going to be RARE. 

Rarity = scarcity
When something is scarce = demand 
demand = price go up ( big green )

2. Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph)
For us regards, this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas. Not by human hands!
These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period. 
The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number ). In the case of bitcoin and  this model, that number is .953, which means that it is 95.3% accurate. To add to this, the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far‚Ä¶ out of any asset that has had power law applied to it. 

So why ramble about all this on here, and how does this relate to coinbase. Well if you look at the graph, we are very likely to expect a price of 150-200k in a years time,and a million in about 10. The reason I don‚Äôt believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin. It‚Äôs here to stay. 

Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide, second to Binance globally and 1st in the US. When it comes to users, it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million, however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users. With this information, imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere. The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it, convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings. 
Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run, all through coinbase with its user friendly interface

Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto, and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools. https://www.coinbureau.com/review/binance-vs-coinbase/#

To conclude. This is quite a long term play. Considering the -20% drop over the past couple days, and the halving coming up by the end of this week, it may be a good time to jump in. 

I‚Äôm full porting this one.
Best of luck my fellow regards. May your accounts be green and lambo‚Äôs in coinbase blue. "
284,"UAL & ASML earnings, LETS START THIS SEASON STRONG",wallstreetbets,AT&T,261,90,16-04-2024 13:47:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c5gjfy/ual_asml_earnings_lets_start_this_season_strong/,"IT'S THAT TIME AGAIN!!!!! Earnings season has just kicked off, and the companies are already hitting the court, ready to show us whether they've shit the bed or not. Let's gear up for a strong start. IT'S GAME TIME BABY!!!!

Today, I've got two companies that I'll be gambling on: **UAL (United Airlines)** and **ASML (no one knows wtf ASML stands for)**. Let's get right into it:

&#x200B;

1. **UAL** \- Look, when I invest in a company, I don't give a fuck about their business as long as they're making money and not heading for bankruptcy. But when the CEO starts pushing their political agenda into their company, that‚Äôs when I start getting a little concerned, and by a little concerned, I mean very concerned. A few months back, the CEO announced a goal for 50% of new hires to be women or people of color. I‚Äôm not a racist or misogynist, but why push DEI into the cockpits? Call me a right wing extremist all you want, but I want the cockpit crew to be chosen for their flying skills, not because of their zigzagzirzemza pronouncs. Scott Kirby don‚Äôt give a shit about his passengers, only about avoiding labels like racist or transphobic. He‚Äôd rather crash 3452 planes than face such accusations, just hire the old white dudes....... This will all backfire, planes will be crashing out of the sky, and he will be testifying in front of Congress. This ain't looking good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll be shorting this tonight.
2. **ASML** \- Everyone knows ASML makes chip-making equipment, and they're from the Netherlands. Nothing good comes out of the Netherlands regarding business, except Shell and ASML. Now that Shell has moved to London in 2022, ASML is also looking to relocate, which has politicians in The Hague stressing. A month ago, they started operation ‚ÄòBeethoven,‚Äô which is basically this: We‚Äôll give you $2.7B in tax breaks, infrastructure investments, build a whole ASML town for your employees, and many, many more things, plzzzz don‚Äôt leaveüò≠üôè. You have to realize: the Dutch elections last year gave ASML a lot of leverage. The party that won the elections (PVV), wants to close all borders, but 40% of ASML‚Äôs employees are foreign. They really want to leave, and are just playing hard to get now, and I predict the government will pump this company to the moon, just to get them to stay in Holland. This will 99.999% reflect in their future guidance. Expect green dildos tomorrow morning.

285,"$VFC : The North Face,Vans , Timberlands",wallstreetbets,AT&T,73,58,16-04-2024 00:16:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c525h5/vfc_the_north_facevans_timberlands/,"## The Turnaround Story

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

288,PAA - Two Ways to Play in 2024,wallstreetbets,AT&T,16,18,15-04-2024 16:08:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4q17t/paa_two_ways_to_play_in_2024/,"There are a couple of DD's out there already around PAA (""Drill Baby Drill! Possible 25 Baggers"" AND ""PAA - Why it can go high, even if oil doesn't"") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26. I bought $20C 8/16 and made a quick 330% profit, but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb. I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year, however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4. That's why I think there are two ways this should be played. My current positions are listed at the end of this thread.

Midstream companies benefit when production is high. They have contracts in place with upstream companies, but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down, BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract.¬†Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2.¬†

**Frac Spread**

What is it? Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US. It's a leading indicator of oil production. Midstream companies, like PAA, thrive when production is high.There was an increase in fracture spread in February, but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year/Year), 2024 compared to same time 2023. The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year. Production is way down compared to this time of year. Same with Rig Counts (see below)¬†Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year, same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023.¬† 

&#x200B;

**Rig Count** 

What is it? Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada. Again, just like Frac Spread, there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024. 

https://preview.redd.it/yqwfn8vw1ouc1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=33519546acc2b3fb95dd24b44a8c0f3101b09b42

[https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024](https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024)

Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2, they were relatively low in Q1. Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high. 

https://preview.redd.it/12vr3cky1ouc1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b90b053824d847e62fab1a25808a378eda3fcd6

Again, I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year, but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2. Keep an eye on frac spread, rig count, and oil prices. If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year, but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction. AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread, rig count, and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price. I'm just not there yet.  I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction. Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price. ¬†This is not financial advice.¬†Just slightly (perhaps fully) regarded and how I think this will play out this year.

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn‚Äôt realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn‚Äôt even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn‚Äôt been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it‚Äôs $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That‚Äôs because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don‚Äôt know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we‚Äôre one bad market day from the dam bursting. 

Long deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls.

291,TSLA earnings ,wallstreetbets,AT&T,29,48,15-04-2024 02:13:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4avx7/tsla_earnings/,"I see Tesla going either way, however I‚Äôm leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. 

1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. 

2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it‚Äôs dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it‚Äôs designed for)
Edit: saw this right after postingüòÇ 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE

3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point‚Ä¶

4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?

Now of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. 
 
1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn‚Äôt all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. 

2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it‚Äôs even more bullish. 

3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. 

In conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?ü§î 

This is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. "

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods.

My prediction, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car, why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!! Buying a network/s would ensure 100% security methods being taken very seriously unlike our present system with telecom companies.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, chair of the Zodiac Group, which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer, the owner of the Zodiac group, at $24 billion, making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war,‚Äù said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-miscalculation-retaliation.html


No direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?

Regardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran‚Äôs best interest to keep oil prices elevated."
297,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,AT&T,648,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."
298,China is the under-reported factor in the rise of Gold and Silver,wallstreetbets,AT&T,106,54,12-04-2024 13:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c29ti8/china_is_the_underreported_factor_in_the_rise_of/,"It may have come to your attention that the price of gold and silver has increased significantly over the last month.

There has been some reporting on the issue, but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the ""usual suspects"" - geopolitical  tensions (check), reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check), and fears about the banking system (check).

All these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.

Gold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.

It is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.

Since around September of last year, **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently, silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.

Now, price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before, but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)

Arbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.

Markets are carefully, and sometimes tightly, ""managed"" by the Chinese government.

For some reason, they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**,  as miners in South America, Mexico, Poland, South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.

This is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China,  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. 

Raw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note, these are in yuan/kilo, so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).

300,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,AT&T,81,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

302,Match Result: TKO,wallstreetbets,AT&T,8,6,11-04-2024 17:52:44,https://i.redd.it/5flqe6x42wtc1.jpeg,"What‚Äôs up Nerds! Long time lurker, first time poster here. I‚Äôve been doing a ton browsing while I wait for Season 2 of Earnings to get rolling and my countless hours of digging for golden tickers may be about to yield fruit. TKO. Let‚Äôs kick round 1 off.

TKO went public last year and was actually able to reach highs over 115 per share. Then the Vince McMahon scandle dropped and you saw the stock submit (üòè) to the market for a few months. Now with that turbulent period appearing further in their rear view, the stock has been on a path back to reclaim its belt.

Round 2. Now the ouster of someone like McMahon is bound to have positive effects for a stock but let‚Äôs take a look at their volume over the past few months. I‚Äôm highly regarded so please excuse wherever this graph ends up on the post. When we look at the SMA we are approaching the smoke and mirrors that is the golden cross. Now this is something I believe is normally reserved for day trading and even with that, a chart doesn‚Äôt mean shit if there‚Äôs not good news surrounding it. The good news however, seems to be in abundance for them. McMahon is gone, recent WWE event had record numbers, UFC 300 incoming (though I expect this to only be a shorter term juice), Netflix deal from January, growing viewership, and a sweet succulent earnings report in the first half of May. All of this in combination with the potential of a big run after a golden cross has me feeling bullish about their direction, even if only for the short term.

3rd and final round. Only 3 because idk how I would do a 5 prong championship round discussion. Over the past month they‚Äôve seen an average weekly increase in the value of their stock of ~$4 per share.  Can a pace like that continue? Not very likely, but even if that were to be cut in half I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely insane to see this stock get back to those 115 highs by earnings or even right after. I also think the value of that Netflix deal can give them a stronger forecast.

Playing this through earnings only so I‚Äôve grabbed May 17 105C. I‚Äôm still regarded and don‚Äôt know how I can include more than one picture. 55 contracts at average cost of 1.81. $9937.23 total on the line. 

Good luck to anyone currently holding or thinking of jumping in. And if you have reasons why they won‚Äôt continue to rise please share your thoughts as maybe I‚Äôve missed some important factors.

304,"Listen up regards, CPI lesson incoming",wallstreetbets,AT&T,0,67,11-04-2024 04:58:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c16n9h/listen_up_regards_cpi_lesson_incoming/,"Look, all of these people on here don‚Äôt seem to understand how the CPI is bullshit and are saying how rare cuts are never gonna happen until 2025. But let me paint you a different picture.

Yes the CPI came in technically hotter than expected, but when you actually dive into the numbers, it tells a different story. The main 3 factors that are causing this higher than 2 percent inflation are 
1. Shelter
2. Electricity 
3. Transportation

Now we‚Äôll look at each individually:
1. Shelter: shelter is calculated on a ‚Äúrenters equivalent‚Äù bullshit term made up to try and fudge the numbers on what people actually pay, but for this explanation, it‚Äôs not that important. What IS important is the fact that shelter is a lagging indicator. When the interest rate hike takes effect, most people don‚Äôt feel the immediate impact of this. Renters have to go through their lease period before rent is raised, and like 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rates so most home owners don‚Äôt feel it either. So shelter being at around 6% is actually the effects of the rate hikes at least 12-18 months prior to this date.

2. Electricity: despite the price of natural gas, coal, and renewable energy all becoming significantly cheaper in the last 4 years, energy prices are up. The only possible explanation to me is profiteering, because there is no reason why with all three of these commodities being so low should electricity be this high. 

3. Transportation: despite its name, one of its largest components is actually car insurance, which has miraculously increased by like 20% yoy because of their ‚Äùfuture modeling‚Äù predicting higher costs to them, which ended up being false. If you check Geico‚Äôs recent quarterly statement, they said they actually had lower costs this year on average. So once again, profiteering.

In the end keeping interest rates high is actually hurting the CPI more by keeping mortgages higher which then translates to higher shelter. Without these 3 CPI numbers, (one of which is a. Lagging and b. Held higher with higher rates while the other two are from profiteering), inflation is already below 2 percent.

TLDR: fed keeping rates higher for no reason because the real data says otherwise "

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf

Provided by ChatGPT: 

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.

Key highlights from the minutes include:

- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.

- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.

- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.

- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.

In summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data."
308,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,AT&T,58,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

The company I‚Äôm talking about is ‚ÄúGreenwave Technology solutions.‚Äù At first I was going to make a bait thread where I fucking edited the price of the stock out and only showed how many shares I owned and once you guys searched up the ticker symbol you‚Äôd fucking laugh your asses off or something lol. But while I was reading their financial statements I did get a bit curious about them, they had less than 10 thousand dollars in net revenues a couple years back, and were taking some serious financial losses even then. It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner, this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do, especially when shit hits the fan, so yeah, I respected that a lot. The company is a small business, it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market, neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them, thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, especially after corona. It hurts me even more since my father is a truck driver, my hats off to the guy, even if I feel like the financials look kind of like doo doo (negative cash flow üíÄ) I like this dudes drive and because of that I like the stonk. üòé"

Are investors just not interested since the lockdown ATH? 

I posted the options interest below. I was hoping it might shed some light on sentiment. Mostly the people trading these don‚Äôt seem too pessimistic but my impression is that sentiment is overall MEH. 

Short interest is about 3.8% of float but there isn‚Äôt much float compared to the total number of shares. Outstanding shares is 5.8% of total, so 94.2% is held close. Could it be because the float is so small? Why is the float so small?

And what‚Äôs with their last earnings report being Q4 2022?? Did they get embarrassed and decide not to publish that anymore??

I‚Äôm new here so I assume I‚Äôm missing something. Are they on the verge of bankruptcy? Are they in a slump? Are we alone in the universe? Much to think about. "
312,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,AT&T,37,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"
313,"Have your boomer parents or uber started talking about NVDA, AI? Is it time exit this ride.",wallstreetbets,AT&T,1428,404,09-04-2024 14:41:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bztupp/have_your_boomer_parents_or_uber_started_talking/,"Preface this with I'm a big NVDA AI fan been on the AI train for years before this

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."
314,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",wallstreetbets,AT&T,289,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Too tired to write more...

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

1200 Jan 2026 calls from $20-$25

I would be happy with 1%-2% increase a week in the stock, we have 9-21 months for the LEAPs"

TL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it‚Äôs undervalued with huge forward looking potential.

Four main points:



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly
2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses
3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue
4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Novo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight & live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they‚Äôll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can‚Äôt make money? I‚Äôll tell you how degens



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly

Novo Nordisk:



* Market cap: 436 B
* Net Sales Growth: +31%
   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%
   * Net Profit Growth: +51%
* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion
* Net Profit Margin: 36%

Eli Lilly:



* Market cap: 745 B
* Net sales growth: +20%
   * Earnings per share: -16%
   * Net profit Change: -16%
* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion
* Net Income Margin: 15.3%

Comparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don‚Äôt short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly‚Äôs out of the water.

Hell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.

The numbers speak for themselves.



1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses

In their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first ‚Äúapproved weight management medicine \[that\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death‚Äù is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a ‚Äúpriority review‚Äù.

Why is this a big deal?

Because according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.

That means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.



1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue

Demand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.

The biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they‚Äôre heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.

‚ÄúIf you produce it, they will come‚Äù



1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Today, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.

But Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.

Now if you‚Äôre too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.

There are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.

The other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.

So yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.

I'm in the process of developing a trading strategy that involves buying 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts or 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts depending on market momentum. If I enter the trade before 2:00 PM, I purchase 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts. If I enter the trade after 2:00 PM, I purchase 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts. The strike price is always as close possible to the money.

¬†I generally know the optimal entry points for my trades, but I often struggle with determining the best exit points.

What‚Äôs your advice on when to exit a trade:

a) Should I exit when the momentum begins to slow down? For instance, if I'm holding a call option, I would sell when the first red candle (on a 15-minute chart) closes below the opening of the last green candle.

b) Should I exit when there‚Äôs a big move in the opposite direction? Based on historical data, this still results in a profit, though I sometimes lose 100% of the money I put in some trades as sometimes there‚Äôs never a big move in the opposite direction.

c) Should I set a fixed take profit or stop loss percentage?

d) Should I rely on ""intuition""?

e) Or should I use another metric?

Any guidance from experienced traders would be greatly appreciated!"
318,$SPY Correlation With Each Individual S&P 500 Company,wallstreetbets,Automatic Data Processing,14,13,03-05-2024 18:55:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cjgeqq/spy_correlation_with_each_individual_sp_500/,"I used Google Sheets and Apps Script to make a tool that can automatically find the any company's correlation with each individual company in the S&P 500. I figured that something like this could be useful for pairs trading strategies.

https://preview.redd.it/qwvqd799d9yc1.png?width=1719&format=png&auto=webp&s=61393dde701621365978925fd0affc87921e25d9

This is what it looks like on the front end and I have other tabs that are a lot uglier looking and store most of the data. The 3 variables I was most interested in measuring were:

* The correlation between any two stocks
* The slope of the regression line between the stock ratio (Stock 1 / Stock 2) v.s. the amount of elapse time
* The current ratio between two stocks versus their average ratio over a given time frame (I called this Relative to Avg)

Using Apps script, I wrote a simple program that repeatedly plugs in various stock tickers into the ""Stock 2"" box and takes each of the three variables mentioned above. Below I have attached a separate sheet that is the result of a test between $SPY and each of the 503 companies in the S&P 500 over a 180 day time frame.

You might have to make a copy of the Google Sheet, but once you do that, you should be able to use the ""Filter"" table on the right to look for companies that meet a specific correlation, slope, or Relative to Avg threshold.

I don't want to share the link to the actual Google Sheet I use to do all of this because it took quite a bit of time and effort, but if anyone has a specific company and time frame they want me to run the program for, I'd be happy to do that and share something similar to the¬†[SPY Correlation Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYyDCTUb8KKtBdxcrRAkAIY0vvE3m2kIVnszvcg3Rlg/edit#gid=1003617349)¬†sheet that I linked above.

I‚Äôm still holding though, I didn‚Äôt full YOLO to 0dtes or weeklies on purpose here. Figured we might get some wild reaction like this. I think we see a rebound this week after earnings is digested and potentially getting more coverage.

Coming from my FinTech experience, this is what I really honed in on during the CNBC interview, when Sara asked about the tech platform:

Noto:
...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, we‚Äôre building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and we‚Äôre the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, we‚Äôre building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and we‚Äôre turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.

322,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Automatic Data Processing,202,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf

Provided by ChatGPT: 

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.

Key highlights from the minutes include:

- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.

- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.

- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.

- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.

In summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data."
324,"DD: ""ADEA"", a sleeping giant chip designer currently toying with the big dogs.",wallstreetbets,Automatic Data Processing,534,244,04-04-2024 15:22:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvpxr3/dd_adea_a_sleeping_giant_chip_designer_currently/,"Hello, fellow regards. I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

‚Äã

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia‚Äôs trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**."
326,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves",wallstreetbets,Bank of America,444,356,29-04-2024 05:59:33,https://i.redd.it/g884d41bzcxc1.jpeg,"OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

(pssht, it was never about retail sales, it was always about FLEETS.) Hybrid vs ICE vs EV. Guess who's winning out, it ain't Tesla, or the EV fam. Go ask Hertz and their stock price about it. Long charging times and range anxiety has Hertz dumping their EV's like a bad time and temperature abused hamburger puke explusion :

How many ice vehicles? : 265 Million, source: https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/fossil-fuels/gas-and-oil/new-registrations-of-gasoline-vehicles-are-still-growing-despite-the-ev-push/#:\~:text=But%20those%20numbers%20barely%20dent%20the%20288.5,were%20at%209.9%20million%20(3.4%20percent%20share).

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

And increasing  
FORD'S RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE IS MASSIVELY GROWING:

Plus it looks like Tesla's FSD and no Anxiety and Quick Fill up for Ford might merge. Rumors about Ford in talks to license FSD would make Ford fleet business unstoppable. A driver that never gets tired installed in every Ford Fleet vehicle to supplement the tired groggy driver, or even replace him or her.

There has been some reporting on the issue, but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the ""usual suspects"" - geopolitical  tensions (check), reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check), and fears about the banking system (check).

All these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.

Gold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.

It is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.

Since around September of last year, **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently, silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.

Now, price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before, but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)

Arbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.

Markets are carefully, and sometimes tightly, ""managed"" by the Chinese government.

For some reason, they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**,  as miners in South America, Mexico, Poland, South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.

This is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China,  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. 

Raw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note, these are in yuan/kilo, so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).

In July 2023, the federal banking agencies proposed changes to implement the Basel III ""endgame"" capital reforms. The published capital rulemaking proposal incorporated an expansive scope and a notable shift in approach by pushing down new Basel capital requirements to all banks with over $100 billion in assets, regardless of their international activities.

Banks are expected to implement the new regs by July 2025 and it's estimated that new capital requirements will increase by anywhere between 19 and 25 percent.

I'm interested in your thoughts on how this will impact regional banks, especially with CRE still being an issue.

Additionally, would you say larger banks could also be impacted by the interplay between new capital requirements and CRE exposure?"
335,What rescheduling Marijuana means,wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,143,121,02-05-2024 23:05:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1citlmg/what_rescheduling_marijuana_means/,"I think a lot of people fundamentally don't understand how monumental the rescheduling of marijuana is. I'm going to lay it out here for you:

Marijuana is going to be rescheduled from a controlled substance 1 to a 3. You may have heard that this puts in the same schedule as things like Tylenol, but so what, right? Why should I care, short that news! No, and I'll tell you why.

1. Rule 280E. This is the bane of the marijuana industry and is the number one reason why businesses have struggled. It states that any business that touches a schedule 1 drug cannot participate in federal programs or benefit from federal tax breaks. This is why the industry pays 40% + in federal taxes, and a total tax rate being in the 60% range in some states. This law will no longer apply to marijuana! That means a double digit tax break industry wide! That means growth and profits like the industry has never seen.
2. Marijuana businesses will have broader access to regular banking. That means lower rates to borrow. Refinancing debt to lower rates. No more risky cash only businesses. That means growth and profits on a massive scale.
3. Marijuana will now be able to be shipped across state lines in the mail.

All of this together will create a boom for the marijuana industry and stocks. It is hard to overstate the impact of the DEA's decision. When this becomes law, cannabis stocks are going to fly. The valuations of every marijuana stock will go up, and there will be a new floor. There are a lot of FUDsters out there trying to scare retail away from these stocks. You saw them short the heck out of them today. They know what is coming and are trying to bring the stocks down so they can get in themselves.

Chicago Bears case:
1. General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance
2. Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US

Chicago Bulls case:
1. Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year
2. Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats
3. The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. 
4. Shorts can‚Äôt help themselves trying to call crash

My positions:
Jan2025 1000c
May 24 950c

The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. 
We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. 

A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. 

The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: 

The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull‚Äôs best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. 

Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. 

The psychology of us ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more.

Good luck everyone! Don‚Äôt do anything impulsive or regarded and please add your disrespectful bear and bull thoughts in the comments. "
338,"AMD's Q1 Call... the good, bad & ugly",wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,118,70,01-05-2024 00:14:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ch88j6/amds_q1_call_the_good_bad_ugly/,"Regarded WSB Community,

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**."

This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

(Source: FT),wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,34,25,22-04-2024 12:34:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ca9l4p/nyse_considering_247_trading_source_ft/,"According to the Financial Times, the New York Stock Exchange (NYSE) is polling market participants on the possibility of trading stocks around the clock, as regulators examine an application for the first 24/7 bourse. The survey highlights growing interest in extended trading hours, particularly among retail investors, who are already able to trade cryptocurrencies and some stocks outside regular hours.

The idea of a 24/7 exchange has gained traction in recent years, driven by the rise of retail investor activity and the availability of other markets, such as US Treasuries and currencies, for trading around the clock. However, institutional interest has been muted due to concerns around liquidity and settlement risk. Some retail brokers already offer 24-hour weekday access to US stocks, but an overnight exchange would require heavy regulatory oversight and approval.

A start-up, 24 Exchange, is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange, with the survey coming ahead of a potential decision. The proposal has sparked debate, with some arguing that extended trading hours would benefit investors, while others raise concerns around staffing, settlement, and market stability. As the SEC scrutinizes the plans, the outcome will determine whether the US stock market will follow the lead of other global markets and cryptocurrencies in offering 24/7 trading.

347,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,198,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

348,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,213,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

351,Potential Estimated Economic Impact (Oil and VIX) of War üáÆüá∑ üáÆüá±,wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,25,37,14-04-2024 21:54:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c45esj/potential_estimated_economic_impact_oil_and_vix/,"*TL;DR: Just look at the image with the three scenarios.*

&#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike‚Äîa direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies‚Äîhas marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:

>Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&#x200B;

The market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:

>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in ‚Äî benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran‚Äôs diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.

&#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&#x200B;

On Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers‚Äîthose who rely on oil prices.

So far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.

&#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war‚Äîor the potential of war‚Äîcan move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me."
352,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,80,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

1. Competition, other insolvent banks could shed light on their insolvency
2. New regulations intended to prevent bank failures
3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid

Here is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:

  
They lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. ""Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December¬†31, 2023, and December¬†31, 2022, respectively.""

On competition:

""The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.""

... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...

Regulation

""Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.""

... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...

Them a bank and don't have money

""We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

I don't want to start a panic. If this bank doesn't fail, we are a lot more fucked than we think we are because it absolutely should. My price target is $.0001. I have the ""courage"" to buy every put you write me at $2.5 so let's do this.

Sitting 160 $20 puts for 2 FOMC meetings out from now."
355,Embracer Group - Swedish stock,wallstreetbets,Bank of New York Mellon,36,34,04-04-2024 17:26:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvt38x/embracer_group_swedish_stock/,"Embracer Group, a prominent player in the gaming industry, has recently experienced a significant downturn in its stock price. However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them.

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let‚Äôs go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here‚Äôs the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, üêª open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won‚Äôt go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can‚Äôt make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon‚Äôs plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that‚Äôs not a good working plan. As I understand, there‚Äôs a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I‚Äôm still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

365,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,"Bath & Body Works, Inc.",200,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

366,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,"Bath & Body Works, Inc.",124,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

The objective target for the counter-move is around $510. ( This is a previous level of demand that will now be supply as trapped buyers look to exit )  
My (custom) stochastic & RSI indicators have triggered counter-rally signals. ( outlined with the vertical blue lines )  
Bear in mind the market just broke the 50-day moving average. This nearly always means more pain is ahead. So expect the counter-rally to fail quickly ( very likely on a touch of the 50-day moving average from below)  
After the counter-rally is over the sell off is expected to continue to fill the gap at $497, left there after NVDA reported earnings.  


If we simply open with a gap up tomorrow at $510, then the counter-rally will likely have already concluded.  
It is extremely risky to trade against the trend. I'm not recommending a trade here. Just sharing my work.

I have further out projections for what I expect to happen after $497. Will share in due time.  
Good luck everyone and stay safe.

I‚Äôve been diving deep into the options market and found what seems to be an overlooked opportunity with SWAV (Shockwave Medical, Inc.). After Johnson & Johnson announced acquiring SWAV for about $12.5-$13.1 billion, setting each share price at $335, it‚Äôs intriguing to see SWAV‚Äôs shares hovering around $328-$329  .

This situation seems particularly interesting for the 4/19 $330 calls. Considering the acquisition price and SWAV‚Äôs current trading price, these calls appear to be trading at a bargain. Currently up 325% today with just an increase of 0.7% in the stock price. With just a slight uptick of 1-2%, these options could see significant gains.



Just a reminder: I‚Äôm not a financial advisor, and this isn‚Äôt financial advice. Always do your research and assess your risk before diving into the market.

372,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,wallstreetbets,"Bath & Body Works, Inc.",26,22,10-04-2024 16:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pinl/pools_closed_why_lesl_is_circling_the_drain/,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes.

380,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal‚Äôs Best Friend,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,66,45,05-05-2024 03:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cki4bo/elf_an_inflationfatigued_gals_best_friend/,"Gather round, friends. We‚Äôre cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

381,When to exit 0DTE/1DTE SPY Calls/Puts,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,14,48,04-05-2024 23:20:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckderf/when_to_exit_0dte1dte_spy_callsputs/,"Hello friends,

I'm in the process of developing a trading strategy that involves buying 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts or 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts depending on market momentum. If I enter the trade before 2:00 PM, I purchase 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts. If I enter the trade after 2:00 PM, I purchase 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts. The strike price is always as close possible to the money.

¬†I generally know the optimal entry points for my trades, but I often struggle with determining the best exit points.

What‚Äôs your advice on when to exit a trade:

a) Should I exit when the momentum begins to slow down? For instance, if I'm holding a call option, I would sell when the first red candle (on a 15-minute chart) closes below the opening of the last green candle.

b) Should I exit when there‚Äôs a big move in the opposite direction? Based on historical data, this still results in a profit, though I sometimes lose 100% of the money I put in some trades as sometimes there‚Äôs never a big move in the opposite direction.

c) Should I set a fixed take profit or stop loss percentage?

d) Should I rely on ""intuition""?

e) Or should I use another metric?

Any guidance from experienced traders would be greatly appreciated!"
382,Pezempic aka Celsius DD Party ,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,33,69,04-05-2024 14:45:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ck1ycs/pezempic_aka_celsius_dd_party/,"All right boys, here it is the DD to end all DDs.

If you pay attention, you might find yourself floating in a green field enjoying the results of your multibagger getting that divorce you've always wanted and in a position for the first time in your life to not have to ask your wife's boyfriend for an allowance.

The play this week is 100% Celsius. Ticker symbol celh.

Google it regards. 

Why do you want to put your entire portfolio into this on Monday? I'll tell you. 

Firstly, this stuff is literally liquid cocaine. I know every single one of you have done cocaine and you all loved it. 
Imagine cocaine in liquid form. This is it. Sales Bros. Everywhere are crushing these things so they can stay awake and hit 40% of their quota.  Managers are crushing these things so they can ask how many dials their teams are making and why they haven't hit their number 3 days into the month.

But here's the rub. It's not just the sales Bros that are getting forced back into the office due to regarded RTO policies anymore. I mean don't get me wrong. That's a big reason why you should be going full port on its own offices are stocking the s*** up like crazy and it's flying off the shelves. But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. 

Secondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. 

I'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.

Thirdly, they're going international. 
They announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. 

Finally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.

That's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. 

That alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.

Now here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. 

Tuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market. 


Position 2 call strats EOW at $85 +
434 shares.

Good luck regards. I'll see you all in Valhalla.

383,"The US Senate is now working to DELIST marijuana from the CSA, effectively legalizing it federally. ",wallstreetbets,Best Buy,1357,314,01-05-2024 07:31:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chg776/the_us_senate_is_now_working_to_delist_marijuana/,"[Full Article](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-statement-on-deas-historic-step-to-reclassify-cannabis-as-less-harmful-drug)

The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act deschedules cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely. This would effectively legalize cannabis at the federal level, removing many operational hurdles.

Then there‚Äôs the SAFER Banking Act, which will make it easier for companies to access capital, and to attract more large-scale investors. 

Rescheduling Cannabis to Schedule III is a game changer on its own. And, if either of these bills become law, we are talking multi-billion dollar market cap increases on some of the best positioned companies in the US (CGC in particular, but also TLRY in my opinion, due to the former's existing warrants to purchase cannabis companies in the US on rescheduling, and TLRY's penchant for expansion and acquisition).

My position: The Biden administration has gone through the bureaucracy of the Health and Human Services and now through the DEA to provide effective health and safety cover for the Senate's upcoming initiative.  This will put the Republican House in the spotlight, and my hope is that they will follow the position of their voters and pass the bill (but they have taken a fairly obstructionist position over the past 2 decades, so who knows, but they have extremely difficult headwinds on their horizon, so I think it looks good!)

When these bill are introduced, I would anticipate fairly significant upside market reactions. When they pass the Senate, we will see even more.  If the Republicans vote with the people and get it out of committee, we will see millionaires being created this year.

My recommendation:  BUY CALLS that expire in JAN 2025 to take advantage of this upside, while giving yourself enough time and room to weather the inevitable hills and valleys the market will go through while these bills make it through the Legislature.  Hold them, and wait.  They are still WAY UNDERPRICED in my opinion, given the rescheduling alone, and now with this news on the horizon.

Good luck everyone!

384,One of these chips is not like the others‚Ä¶ Laying the bull and bear case for NVDA,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,13,19,01-05-2024 04:17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chd3ny/one_of_these_chips_is_not_like_the_others_laying/,"TLDR at the top.

Chicago Bears case:
1. General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance
2. Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US

Chicago Bulls case:
1. Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year
2. Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats
3. The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. 
4. Shorts can‚Äôt help themselves trying to call crash

My positions:
Jan2025 1000c
May 24 950c

The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. 
We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. 

A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. 

The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: 

The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull‚Äôs best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. 

Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. 

The psychology of us ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more.

Good luck everyone! Don‚Äôt do anything impulsive or regarded and please add your disrespectful bear and bull thoughts in the comments. "
385,"$ALCC, be careful of the merger dilution",wallstreetbets,Best Buy,35,41,30-04-2024 14:33:52,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgucnw/alcc_be_careful_of_the_merger_dilution/,"I know people see the current MC of 633m and their eyes pop out seeing a ton of room to grow. The problem is that the MC is based on 30 million shares. Once the merger is complete, it will then be based on 165 million shares.

This means you now have $6 a share for every billion in market cap. I know DJT is seen as the new marker here for big name SPAC hype but Sam Altman still does not have the common man name rec of the Agent Orange. To equal DJT at a huge 6.5 bill cap, it would hit just roughly $40 a share. Let's say it still does great and reaches a colossally overvalued $3.5 billion market cap, generously more than half of DJT, that is just around $20 a share. 

With the current share price at $15, the risk/reward of a $15 -> $20 best case seems dubious.

I bring this up not to rain on any parades, but because I to was tempted, but before I could click Buy, I had to really give it some thought on a fair hyped up valuation.

Best of luck if you are still charging hard into it. Maybe I'll regret not buying."

[Not all yolos are created equal. And to my credit half of my port is still with me.](https://preview.redd.it/zirqo70i65xc1.png?width=1375&format=png&auto=webp&s=ff105181485e21bf24ceecb25b2c8a3a4853f134)

You might wonder how I ended up in this erm, position. 

*record scratch*

For the sake of amusement and educational value, I certainly hope some of you might learn from my mistakes instead of stepping on the same rake.

It all began a few weeks ago.

https://preview.redd.it/5dbpqb1u65xc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14416697d69805e00b82eb53b072617b20a466dd

I got greedy. And greedy people make mistakes.

When Trump's Truth Social became a public company with the shittiest fundamentals known to mankind, no business plan and staggering losses, it was a no-brainer to short it. I learned options just so I could!

And the money was good. My first short had an expiration date of Jan 2025 and the strike price was $25. But because of all the greeks and short interest I sold it at a profit when DJT traded over $30! Wild. It retained its value so well because of long expiration date (theta).

Then I did some other trades, most of them reasonably successful and briefly my account went above $200k. That gave me a sense of false confidence. Easy money! Why, I could just make a thousand dollars a day shorting this thing and calling that thing. I just need a bit more practice. Right?

What I realized is that some options turn a profit in seconds and others can take days and weeks. And 1% for a minute of your time is better returns than 15% after two weeks of incubation.

Then I noticed that of all the trades I made the one that persistently delivered was DJT. It just kept sliding down on a schedule. It had places to be, somewhere between $0 and $2, as it seemed at the time.

So I yolod over 40k on a bet I thought would take a day or two at most. And to make it more profitable I reduced the expiration date to only a couple of weeks, so I could get more contracts for the price.

And then DJT shot up, changing trajectory that has been very predictable up to that point.

Why? Because it trades on sentiment, not fundamentals. Because market conditions. Because boohoo some evil hedgefund managers buy up shares so they can sell shorts and the low trade volume makes it easy to manipulate the stock price? BULLSHIT. These are self-delusions and lies. I don't know why, and never will, because I'm a retail trader and not an institution. 

THE EASIEST LIE IS THE ONE YOU TELL YOURSELF.

I can do my own research, sure, but I don't have the time to make it a full time job. Because of this, I will not have all the information that professionals have at their disposal. I hardly know what questions to ask.

A couple days later, looking at DJT (it should bounce down any day now!) I bought another put, this time aiming for $29 (it was trading around $30). I think they call it 'revenge trading' or 'emotional trading'. Don't do that.

Don't double down on a bad bet. Our brains use a lot of cheat codes to make snap decisions in stressful situations. We get adrenaline, our hearts start racing, our palms start sweating and our brains shut down higher brain functions to improve reaction time, known as 'fight or flight' response. It's great for hunting tigers and wolves. It's a really bad idea to do this when math is involved. And our tech is evolving faster than our bodies.

If you think you might be getting upset and not thinking things through, it's time to stop for the day and come back to it in the morning.

What else? Don't bet more than 10% of your port on any one company or event. Diversify. 

If you keep betting an increasing amount of money, no matter how certain the odds are, eventually the revolver drum will find the one bullet that will take you out in the Russian roulette you build out of your option contract. You're building a mouse trap to catch yourself, so uh, pad the walls a little. Make it a bit comfy.

As for me, I think my best option (teehee) is to fold and liquidate those bets on Monday on the best terms I can find, so I stop chasing the sunk cost fallacy and invest in something that can be more predictable in turning a profit. But I'm open to suggestions! I can't say that it's not tempting to let my puts ride all the way to $0. Part of me keeps wondering if it sinks down to 28 this week for no reason at all. But I also recognize this as a stage of grief known as 'bargaining'. 

I also believe DJT is still a penny stock that will go to $2 in September when Trump cashes out his cut and the price goes down, but my contracts don't have that long. Until September, it will fluctuate wildly, 1-15% a day in either direction as foreign interests and local patriots press buttons to make the money machine go brrr for fun and profit.

Could I straddle it and make some money back? Sure, but there are safer ways to make money right now and I'm going to focus on things with higher probabilities of success. 

This was the most expensive lesson of my life and if you read this far, you got it for free. You're welcome.

So stop munching on those crayons and think about contingency plans instead of throwing all your money on the next ""sure thing"". Options give you higher profits but there is a cost. And that cost is, you can lose everything. When a share price goes down, shares usually don't drop 30% in a day. 

So if you don't want your epitaph to be ""expired worthless"", think a little harder and double check the dates before you piss your money and metaphors against the wind.

387,Investing Pivot,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,40,33,27-04-2024 20:26:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ceo2kh/investing_pivot/,"I've been an active investor in ETFs and individual stocks since graduating college in 2010. I've tried a little bit of everything and learned a lot (from good investments and some really bad ones) along the way. I've done broad market ETFs, sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, commodity ETNs, penny stocks, risky biotech stocks that \*might\* go to the moon but will probably get pink slipped, solid large cap stocks, memestocks, option spreads, option calls and puts. etc... It's been a wild ride and I've learned a lot. While I made a lot of bad investments, I am grateful that I didn't do anything too reckless and only gambled a little bit of my money on insane ideas.

Overall my portfolio has done well in the past 14 years so I feel like I made money while going to school. I made a few really good large investments in large cap ETFs and a few companies that have done extremely well (NVDA, ANET, META, CYBR, BRK/B) But now it's time to simplify.

Now I am applying all those lessons learned to update my portfolio holdings to just the ETFs and companies I believe in for the long term. At the end of last year I had a lot of random little investments in all kinds of companies and ETFs and it was just ridiculous. Over 60 individual company stocks and dozens of different ETFs. I took diversification to an extreme that just wasn't making a difference and holding me back due to opportunity cost.

What I'm looking to do now is to sell off all the random ETFs and stocks that aren't my top picks. The famous saying from Warren Buffet about diversification I believe holds true about ETFs as well as individual companies. ""*If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.""*

Now I'm not nearly as good at evaluating companies as Warren Buffett. So my approach will be to identify my shortlist of favorite ETFs for long term growth as well as a few high conviction companies. I will consolidate my holdings into just these etfs / stocks.

I've done a lot of research this is where I've landed. I will rebalance as needed to make sure i don't get overly concentrated.

Large Cap US S&P 500: VOO / SPLG

Dividend Growth: VIG

Large Cap Growth: SCHG

Mid Cap Growth: IMCG

Mid Cap Value: COWZ

Small Cap Value: CALF

Semiconductors: SMH

I'm also experimenting a little with GPIQ and SPHY for yield, but I'm more focused on growth than yield at this point.

As for individual stocks, my key holdings are:

NVDA

META

GOOG

BRK.B

TSLA

CYBR

ANET

AVGO

MSFT

AMZN

PLTR

I realize this is very large cap growth / tech stock heavy... especially with some of my stock holdings also representing a significant weighting in the ETFs. But I am ok with this.I'm done with ETFs for REITS, Emerging Markets, International. In both good and bad economic environments since 2010 they don't typically provide outperformance and I would have been way better off just putting the money into a US S&P500 fund. I don't see any compelling reason to keep any money in these kind of funds anymore.I was looking for potential exposure to more small caps (esp growth) but I haven't found an ETF that is all that compelling in this space.

Curious what feedback people have. Is there something big I'm missing by avoiding International and REITs? Am I too concentrated in large cap tech? Am I leaning way too much on good past performance of large caps? Are there any fantastic ETFs I should considering adding to my short list?

For years I tried to buy beat up sectors and stocks hoping they would outperform, but I've seen just the opposite. So my strategy now is to stay relatively diversified into ETFs / companies that have a history of consistent strong performance and strong business models."

Okay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.

For all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside.

Let‚Äôs Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:

I‚Äôm not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

https://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20

**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b

Next is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.

\*\*Terminal Value (TV)\*\*= FCF2033 √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r ‚Äì g) = US$3.7b√ó (1 + 2.3%) √∑ (7.1%‚Äì 2.3%) = US$79b

\*\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\*\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b√∑ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b

Crunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billionüí∞üí∞üí∞

Now, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.

Compared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! üìà

Now, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don‚Äôt make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.

So, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.

TLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy‚Äôs while the rest of us count our tendies üí∞üçü

389,About that Falling Knife - Tesla,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,109,163,23-04-2024 01:51:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1casmnu/about_that_falling_knife_tesla/,"It's time boys and girls. Earnings season is back and there is one sharp knife in the collection. TSLA. Yep, the price action on this is insane towards the $150 April 26th puts.

Who here has leveraged their house on a third HELOC at 9.66% to buy into the downside of this fantastic firesale? I know I have.

Nothing can stop this train wreck to coming to a completion after tomorrow's earnings.

What wild and crazy thing will Elon say that can save this ship from an impending port side collapse?

Look no further than previous earnings calls to get a load of what might be in store.

>If interest rates come down quickly, I think margins will be good and if they don't come down quickly they won't be that good,"" he said. ""We have lots of people who want to buy our car, but simply can't afford it.

I don't know Mr. Musk, Ford motor company is offering the Mach E for 0.00 apr financing for 72 months. Interest rates aren't coming down anytime soon so the notion that Musk can call out to full year guidance isn't even a realistic thing. Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye.

What's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot.

What about this doozy of a foresight

>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,"" Musk said. ""Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff.

I don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the ""chips"".

[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)

Nvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture.

The point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players.

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.

>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year.""¬†

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.

Matter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.

In the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

No doubt the dating app business is tough because many of the users leave the app once they find success.  Plus, many users don‚Äôt pay for the premium subscriptions.  However, this company is about to turn the corner to profitability and has been far too beat up.  The avg analyst estimate for next year‚Äôs earnings is $.93.  Add a 21X multiple, which is honestly low for a company growing its annual revenue 16%.  You get $19.53.  Discount it back by one year at 7% and its $18.25.   Add a 30% margin of safety and you get $12.77.   I‚Äôm a buyer at any price below $12.77.    I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised if this company became an acquisition target.  Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.  They could easily promote the app and cut down on the company‚Äôs main expense (advertising). 

EA
Current Price $126
Target Price $148
Avg analyst estimate is $7.58 EPS next year.  With a 21X multiple and discounted back a year at 7%, you get $148.  Plus the new EA SPORTS‚Ñ¢ College Football 25  coming out this summer is going to sell like crazy.  I‚Äôve been waiting 11 years for this game. But the main thing I love about this company is how much more efficient video game production will become over the next decade as designers and programmers can use AI to expedite the process.  I also love TTWO stock for the same reason.  

RIVN
Current price $8.92

This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.  The EV market is in trouble short term, but still has huge long term upside. Rivian sells it‚Äôs trucks for less money than it currently costs to produce them.  Never good.  Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA
Current price $150.6
Target Price $294
Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."

We are HISTORICALLY overbought, plain and simple. Anytime SPX has been above this line, it hasn‚Äôt failed in 100 years.

Sue me if I‚Äôm wrong, you can take my student loan payments with the little bit of discretionary income I have.

If you‚Äôre not going to dump your shares, then buy protective puts against your 401K, Roth IRA, or whatever portfolio you got. Even if it‚Äôs just one single LEAP put.

&#x200B;

* Lockheed won a $17 BILLION dollar Missile Defense contract 
* Initial funding upon award, with incremental payments based on development milestones.  (Aka they are getting money NOW for this project, RIGHT NOW)

Now you typical Red Candle Lickers would start buying shares in LMT but this is REGARDED short sighted behavior. Because that 17B isnt profit, it has to be used to R&D, test ,build and most importantly SOURCE MATERIALS for the project. So here comes the play!!!

&#x200B;

The real winner of these defense contracts is the suppliers of the actual advanced composite materials. They will actually see the real profit of these contracts. And the best one in the business HEXCEL. (HXL)

&#x200B;

* **Hexcel (HXL):**  A leading producer of advanced composite materials used in aerospace and defense applications.  
* a huge long time partner and supplier of Lockheed (LOCKED IN)
* Hexcel recently appointed a new CEO, Tom Gentile, the former CEO of Spirit Aero Systems and GE Aero (you think this guy doesn't have huge connections?)
* The ""street"" pretended to not like the news of the new CEO and sold off 20% in a single day. fueck em!! all this means is that HXL has a huge margin of safety built in. This aint a damn meme stock boys

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You want more? the new CEO reaffirmed the already extremely positive guidance for 2024 provided on Feb 20th including their outlook from 2024-2026!! REAFFIRMED! Do you really think the CEO that oversaw some of the largest stock market gains in GE and Spirit Aero is really gonna shit the bed enough to warrant a 22% drop/ 1.5 billion dollar market cap? hell naw billy!!  


My play? I'm in long and heavy because plays like this dont give a shit about rate cuts or how many lattes your coworker Susan is buying. 

$40k margin'ed up to $80k worth of stock

CHEAP AS FUC $1.25  $65 5/17 calls (earnings is 4/22 so 4/19 plays are meh)

NEED MORE?  CHEAP AS FUC $1.90  $65 6/21 calls  or $70 for $0.85

CHEAP AS FUCK $ 2.15 $70 9/20 CALLS, This captures earnings along with a rate cut even though it doesnt matter, it still might juice the market if it happens.

393,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

394,Easy 63% gain on your capital in 5 months - ALCC,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,16,34,16-04-2024 22:02:55,https://i.redd.it/eqqnhpvbzwuc1.png,"

I've not had the best of luck buying calls and puts, so the next best thing is to sell calls and puts. I can't do naked calls, but cash secured puts are OK. ALCC is the SPAC led by my personal hero Sam Altman, and in the process of merging with Oklo. While the final date for the reverse merger is set for July 12, things could happen and delay a bit. 

In the mean time the stock has been trading around 12-13 range, and when you look at the option chains on ALCC you'll notice the rich premiums provided by the long OTM puts. I went ahead and put 25k down (10 contracts) as deposit for the put (while collecting ~5% APR on that cash) and got $16,090 of premium to do as I please. If I don't buy any equities with that money in essence I'm getting 5 months of interest on 41k of cash.

From another perspective, I'm essentially buying ALCC at $8.91/share, or 30% discount on today's closing prices. 

If ALCC becomes huge, my 100 shares that I'm wheeling will reap the benefits, and I would have gotten 16k for free, a 64% return on 25k in 5 months. 

If ALCC bombs and closes below 25 and I'm assigned those 2500 shares, as long as the price is above 8.91 in September I would have still made money.

Of course if ALCC super bombs I'll be holding the bag, but seriously with a name like Sam Altman instead of Donald Trump I'm pretty bullish that I'll make money no matter what. 

TL;DR position:
100 shares of ALCC

So here is the thing. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto, and it made me realize 2 things 

1. After the bitcoin halving, which btw is meant to be on 4/20, the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold. This, for the highly regarded, means it‚Äôs going to be RARE. 

Rarity = scarcity
When something is scarce = demand 
demand = price go up ( big green )

2. Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph)
For us regards, this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas. Not by human hands!
These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period. 
The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number ). In the case of bitcoin and  this model, that number is .953, which means that it is 95.3% accurate. To add to this, the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far‚Ä¶ out of any asset that has had power law applied to it. 

So why ramble about all this on here, and how does this relate to coinbase. Well if you look at the graph, we are very likely to expect a price of 150-200k in a years time,and a million in about 10. The reason I don‚Äôt believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin. It‚Äôs here to stay. 

Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide, second to Binance globally and 1st in the US. When it comes to users, it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million, however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users. With this information, imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere. The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it, convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings. 
Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run, all through coinbase with its user friendly interface

Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto, and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools. https://www.coinbureau.com/review/binance-vs-coinbase/#

To conclude. This is quite a long term play. Considering the -20% drop over the past couple days, and the halving coming up by the end of this week, it may be a good time to jump in. 

I‚Äôm full porting this one.
Best of luck my fellow regards. May your accounts be green and lambo‚Äôs in coinbase blue. "

A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       

We are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap‚Äôs are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.

398,TSLA Earnings and Protecting Against IV Crush Help,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,4,12,12-04-2024 23:28:11,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2nkuy/tsla_earnings_and_protecting_against_iv_crush_help/,"TSLA's earnings are after hours 4/23. I want to hold puts through earnings and sell on 4/23.

There will be IV crush, and I am wondering how I can best protect against it while still making a reasonable profit.

Thus far, the best potential courses of action I have thought of are:

1. Buying DEEP ITM puts (defined as 10 dollars ITM) with an expiry of 4/26
2. Buying DEEP ITM puts with an expiry of 5/24 or perphaps a bit longer

My questions and confusion are:

1. what is more important in protecting against IV crush - purchasing ITM beforehand or having a longer expiry date?
2. Does it matter how ITM I should be? Is there any big difference between purchasing 5 dollars ITM or 10 dollars ITM?
3. I am confused about theta's impact on IV crush, especially since I plan on only holding my options for 1 day

If theta/time is extrinsic value, and IV crush only affects extrinsic value really, plus the fact I only plan on holding for 1 day or so, shouldn't I go with the weekly option?

I have advised some people saying a longer expiry is better to defend against IV crush, but I don't understand that because longer expiry = more extrinsic value = more value to be killed during IV crush, right?

Essentially, if I want to play the 4/23 earnings, and sell on 4/23, what combination of ITM + expiry should I use? How far in the money and what expiry would you advise?

Thanks."
399,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,27,22,10-04-2024 16:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pinl/pools_closed_why_lesl_is_circling_the_drain/,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

Positions:   
Short the Stock
$5 puts expiring 11/15.

Within 2 hours and 45 minutes, the entire market took a dump and I sold the position for $40.8K. 

Today, I opened a $16K position into APR26 expiring $160.00 $TSM calls. I believe the fundamentals and performance for TSMC are top notch and have not changed. The earthquake in Taiwan has been confirmed to have had little impact to TSMC operations and should not effect forward looking statements in a considerable way. TSMC is also a unique company in that they report monthly revenue figures. This reporting is expected this Wednesday (4/9/24) and should give clear visibility into earnings which is currently scheduled for 4/18/24. 

The awarding of Biden's $6.6B U.S. production for TSMC's Arizona foundry is the icing on cake which I believe was not properly baked into the stock during today's trading session. Wanted to post here ahead of time as I've been seeing people only post after their exit. 

  
Note: I do not know when I will be selling out of the position. It maybe after the monthly revenue figures on Wednesday if we get a solid beat and the stock rallies. Since revenue figures are posted on a monthly basis, the earnings report is primarily useful for the forecast. If the forecast is anything short of phenomenal, I am expecting a sell the news moment which may not be worth the risk. Also important to note that Wednesday's CPI and FOMC meeting along with Thursday's PPI updates could result in meaningful updates so definitely trade with caution. Lastly, I may or may not add more to this position as this week continues and will keep anyone interested updated! Good luck

401,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,Best Buy,20,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

Not only that, we have initial jobless claims and PPI MoM releasing the next day. 

Clearly, there‚Äôs no synchronicity within the fed as you have some saying they‚Äôre on the right path and others saying the opposite. What these people say has a huge impact on the market as seen last week and next week could see some serious damage. 

My guess is they‚Äôre going to come to a conclusion they‚Äôre only going to do 1 cut sometime this year, maybe 2 if we‚Äôre lucky. 10 year yield is at 4.4% and inflation is still creeping up. The market is in serious need for a correction and they know they should rip the band-aid off now before election season. 

I‚Äôll most likely buy $7.5 UVXY 4/19 calls on Monday or Tuesday depending on what happens Monday. If positive news comes out next Wednesday, best believe I‚Äôll be buying SPY calls. SPY has literally been trading sideways for almost 2 months now and market confidence is uncertain at this point. Next week will make or break the bull market.

404,Best ways to give yourself odds,wallstreetbets,Best Buy,120,115,06-04-2024 13:41:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxbvb0/best_ways_to_give_yourself_odds/,"It's very common for people to call day traders ""gamblers"", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. 

It only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). 

So, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet, place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. The more hands a gambler plays, the more likely they are to walk out with financial losses (bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49... = CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DRUNK AS SHIT AND YOUR MONEY IS ALL GONE!). 

The stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. 

Say a strategy gives 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). A trader would likely never have such excessive drawdown in their account that they'd be out of the game, and moreso as the percent of risk per their account shrinks. 

For instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. 

Sometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. Say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. 

What about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and buy a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move past the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).

Of course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. 

Just a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. 

Trading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. 

It's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner. 

Anyways, to those who read this far -- toodles! And good luck! üëç Share your personal favorite strategy/setup that works best for you if you will. "

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) finally pulled back to my $440 entry point today.  I am all in with 50 Jan 25 options at $480 strike (bought as ULTA hit my trigger).

NOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  

While the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.

A few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:

üí∞ Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data

üíÑ Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way

üíØ Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year

While it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.

The panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450. Elite loyalty ecosystem, smart multi-channel strategy, and flawless execution - what's not to like?? I know analysts are sharpening their pencils, expect possible buy recommendations and a snap back."

Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

409,RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?,wallstreetbets,BlackRock,12,27,06-04-2024 01:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwzo8y/rh_and_blk_and_coming_earnings_and_why_i_shorted/,"Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that.

Have consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \[link to consumer reviews\].

Now, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to ""several weather"" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.

Logically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.

Let's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.

According to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.

Could this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.

Now, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.

I am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.

Anyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.

So, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

I expect this gradual decline to continue, even though I believe it's a long-term buy.

One of the issues is that people tend to get very emotional when discussing Boeing, and that's a problem in itself. But in the short to medium term, Boeing will also be suffering from some significant cash flow challenges:

1. Defense Business: Boeing is working through some very poor defense contracts. These will roll off in the coming years, but defense margins remain very poor in the meantime.
2. Commercial Business: Boeing has had to deal with poor contracts from the COVID-19 pandemic, unproductive production lines, and inventory issues. The news flow doesn't help, and it's possible they may not get back to full production until next year.
3. Services Business: This part of the business is doing fine, but how long can it support the two money-losing segments?

The underlying value is there, but these fundamental cash flow issues go beyond just the negative news. In the next 3-6 months, I believe Boeing is a bad buy.

The stock should benefit from a reset, but that will be difficult given Boeing's semi-governmental status and the politics they have to manage. It's essentially a value trap right now. I think it's a screaming buy once they work through these problems, but not yet.  Stay away!"

So today it came to light that the FAA is investigating Boeing, not because of additional issues related to the 737 Max, but rather due to a whistleblower coming forth and raising concerns about the 787 Dreamliner AND the 777 where not only does the whistleblower claim that Boeing took shortcuts, but that he was also retaliated against for raising the issues.

But let's say that you knew that already. So why could puts be the strategy for next week? Because next week Boeing will be testifying in front of congress (well, a subcommittee in the Senate, but still!). They will be asked about all of the issues that have popped up with the 737 for the past few years and now also the reports regarding the 787 and 777. There is absolutely no good news that can come out next week to redeem them short of another company purchasing Boeing and that is almost impossible to happen as Boeing itself is at no risk of being in financial trouble any time soon even with all the issues they have.

438,Delta Airlines ($DAL) ER DD,wallstreetbets,Boeing,44,74,08-04-2024 21:40:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzabys/delta_airlines_dal_er_dd/,"Hi Regards,

I will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).

I may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.

My position: $48.5C

The other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.

  
Here is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \~8% to 12% post earnings:

1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%

2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share

3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.

4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).

5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:

Bonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):

***""So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.""***

***""Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***

***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***

***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***

***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.""***

This is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.

This is NOT financial advice.

Best Regards,

Baymax

439,This week's game - a secular rally coming?,wallstreetbets,Boeing,69,72,08-04-2024 03:26:34,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bynsdw/this_weeks_game_a_secular_rally_coming/,"Earnings season is in full swing, and there are some easy pickings if you're on the long side. Here are some key projections:

**CPI:**

* CPI is likely to come in about 10 basis points under consensus expectations per my model.
* Despite a hot jobs report and rising gas prices, productivity gains and a slowing pace of rent/rent equivalent increases will keep CPI in check.
* This could put rate cuts back on the table.
* If this thesis holds, expect the Russell 2000 (RUT) and Nasdaq-100 (QQQ) to rally.
* Money draining from bonds to stocks this Wednesday.

**Banks:**

* JPM may kick off a bank rally.
* If the inflation thesis holds, banks will start to look awfully cheap as earnings come through.

**Tech Names:**

* Not every stock will move up - track the fundamentals.
* GOOG and AAPL are likely to outperform NVDA (this might be a hot take, but it doesn't say anything of long-term prospects, but the fact NVDA susceptible to some bumps, whereas AAPL negativity is peaking just as it has for GOOG).
* META and NFLX looking pretty solid in the short term.
* Look for unloved tech names that have been left behind due to the AI hype (e.g. AAPL).
* Cybersecurity and IT services companies are expected to benefit.
* Non-AI chip companies offer a safer downside play with potential upside.

**Energy/Utilities:**

* The oil sector is getting crowded, so target utilities and natural gas exposure instead.
* A note on oil prices: $100 oil is not what it used to be.  US is relatively insulated from the negative impact due to its domestic production.  In fact, high oil and high stock markets can coexist.

**Gold:**

* Save yourselves, there are better plays. Goldbugs will not love this market into the year.  As inflation comes down, so will Gold.  Start taking the profits.

There may be some pockets to short, like Boeing or Tesla, but be cautious and use stop losses, as these names could get caught up in a broader market rally.  Time to buy, buy, buy!

PS - Some have reached out for recommendations.  I noted some names that will be interesting to invest in here: [Today's game](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwh7qk/todays_game_strong_buy_signals_from_the_market/).  I am partial to cybersecurity as a sector, given it is likely to benefit from the overall trends I have noted.

446,SPACs - The Art of The Steal - Analytics of DeSPACS,wallstreetbets,Booking Holdings,9,9,05-05-2024 15:00:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckt6ik/spacs_the_art_of_the_steal_analytics_of_despacs/,"I write this post as a forewarning to those looking to invest into SPACs and DeSPACs. Over the long-run even DeSPACs that are well known typically underperform the market. I thought I would share the data I collected, so that others might be better informed with their stock purchases.

**THE WELL KNOWN DeSPACs**

https://preview.redd.it/yggey68tgmyc1.png?width=1618&format=png&auto=webp&s=27071d634875b20ce5d77222e74f3af9272e6af0

There are many more then just this. But I chose these as they were some of the most hyped DeSPACs over the last few years. You can probably see that the majority are deep red.

**WELL LETS LOOK AT ALL THE SPACS I ANALYZED (mainly from 2021-2024):**

I analyzed 448 DeSPACs in total to understand the full picture. If the company was bought out I set the price equal to the buyout price. If the price merged and the investor received stock, I calculated it based on the price of the stock that it merged with.

[IPO offering price is typically 10 dollars and has been adjusted for reverse splits. This is close to the price the insiders originally valued the company at \(typically overvalued still\).](https://preview.redd.it/zk914wivgmyc1.png?width=667&format=png&auto=webp&s=54638a20be30e2e0b097140fff4adf138a7039b7)

So yeah, If you are a long-term holder of a DeSPAC, you have a higher chance of the company going Bankrupt/Delisted/Liquidated than being profitable on your purchase if you bought at what the insiders valued the company at.

**OTHER STATS:**

Average Return: -68.8% Probability of >100% Return: 1.56% (only 7)

Probability of losing 90% or more: 42.63% Probability of losing 99.9% or more: 10.04%

**THE 33 PROFITABLE TICKERS AS OF 05/05/2024:**

ADSE 9.2% BWMX 121.03% ZGN 27.10% BOWL 25.45% ROIV 12.10%

LFG 160% CLBT 7.2% CCCS 8.10% ROVR 10% ENVX 0.90%

PNT 25% PWP 54.9% JBI 37.8% HIMS 12.6% NAMS 118.2%

MTAL 28.5% ABL 20.6% ENGN 55.1% AIRJ 14.5% SOC 7.4%

DJT 379.3% TH 12% DKNG 317.9%

I'm not goin to list the 415 that are red, but the average return for just the red ones are -78.99%.

**THE THREE SPACS THAT ARE GETTING SHILLED CURRENTLY:**

**DJT (TRUTH SOCIAL) -**¬†The stock has 40M free float and up to 210M full float when all is said and done. Trump has registered to sell all of his shares on the SEC filing dated the 15th of April (He owns 55% of the potential full float or about 65% of current float). He will be able to sell roughly in September, unless he gets a waver, then he may be able to sell earlier. Does not mean he will sell all his shares, but he does owe 1/2B in legal fees currently. Also there is 20M in Warrants that can get converted. LCID tanked 20% on the day that the warrants converted over.

*If you are buying a stock that was valued by the insiders at around $10 for the IPO, and you are spending double to triple the value that the insiders overvalued the company at, well all I can say is good luck to you.*

**ALCC (OKLO)-**¬†Company is NOT an AI stock, it is a nuclear stock without approval from the NRC. It is nothing but an idea until they get approved. I'm all for Nuclear and would like to see this stock succeed, but it has a lot of hurdles to go through, and by hurdles I mean likely dilution to cover various business operations until they might get approval.

**SKGR (WEBULL) -**¬†let me say SOFI is down -30%. Financial stocks through SPACs don't always tend to do the greatest.

**AUTHORS FINAL THOUGHTS:**

So before you get into the hype train -take a step back and make sure you understand the long-term outlook for these companies. Doesn't mean you can't trade them, just know what you are holding. An informed investor is better than someone who takes DD from a Wendy's worker.

Also, I conducted a seance with Victor Hugo, this is what he said about SPAC investors:

""The One Shall Kill The Other"" -By that, the SPAC shall kill the retail investor. We shall now construct your financial future if you buy these stocks at 2x - 4x the initial IPO offering Price ($10): You have become a tatterdemalion sitting beside the refuse of the sandwich shop in Paris owned by Dame de Wendsly. Long are your days, and longer are you nights. Your daily activity is to make gibberish sounds to the passerby that sounds like the letters G U and H smooshed into some illiterate nonsense.""

Thanks Victor, also check out my book:

[This is Not a Real Book](https://preview.redd.it/qmy7c4lygmyc1.png?width=652&format=png&auto=webp&s=708ade020dd2a41d0f163453a89b104f53413ed6)

I have no positions on any DeSPAC or SPAC currently. I plan to enter into some sort of spread on DJT once I can better predict when the warrants will convert. (Trump's Accountant just got axed, so could be a while as there will likely need to be an amendment to their registration filing. Rather convenient for the whole fighting of the short seller thing the CEO keeps going on about.)"

SNDL trades well below book value, has no debt, and is cash flow positive. I also own some Cresco and Greenthumb but if you just look at valuation SNDL seems to be trading at 1/3rd ish valuation to some of those U.S. multi state operators when you look at comparable stats. SNDL currently trades at .66 of tangible book value compared to 1.83 for greenthumb.

448,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves",wallstreetbets,Booking Holdings,443,356,29-04-2024 05:59:33,https://i.redd.it/g884d41bzcxc1.jpeg,"OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

453,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,Booking Holdings,78,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

454,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,Booking Holdings,8713,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."
455,Food for thought - CCL - 5/17 $16c,wallstreetbets,Booking Holdings,26,36,05-04-2024 16:39:21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bwmn4k,"You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôve gathered you all here today. 

CCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B

Around 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.

In 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.

CCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. 

RCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. 



-CON-
CCL‚Äôs long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. 

-HOWEVER-

During last quarter CCL‚Äôs operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. 

CCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, ‚ÄúOur responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders‚Äù

I‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs money to be made here. Love to hear some thoughts on this."
456,Coinbase will Moon after Q1 Earnings. (chart included),wallstreetbets,Broadridge Financial Solutions,23,39,30-04-2024 23:58:52,https://i.redd.it/32tct52sgpxc1.jpeg,"My grandma and your grandma were both talking about crypto while playing bridge at the senior home. With the launch of ETF, bitcoin went mainstream.

Rest written by AI:

Based on the graph you provided showing Exchange Normalized Trade Volume and the context of recent events, here's a bullish thesis for Coinbase regarding their upcoming Q1 earnings report:

### Coinbase Bull Thesis for Q1 Earnings Report

#### 1. **Increased Trading Volume and Revenue**
   - The graph indicates significant spikes in trading volume from January to March 2024. These periods of high trading volume are critical because they directly correlate with increased transaction fees, which are a primary revenue source for Coinbase. Given the substantial peaks, especially in February and March, Coinbase's revenue from trading fees is likely to have seen considerable growth in Q1.

#### 2. **Introduction of ETFs and Management Role**
   - The introduction of cryptocurrency-related ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) during this quarter, with Coinbase reportedly managing most of them, presents a significant growth opportunity. ETFs attract both retail and institutional investors, broadening Coinbase's customer base. Management of these ETFs not only generates management fees but also boosts trading volumes on the platform, further increasing transaction-based revenues.

#### 3. **Market Sentiment and Adoption**
   - The heightened activity and spikes in the normalized trade volume suggest increased market adoption and interest in cryptocurrencies. As a leading platform, Coinbase benefits from higher overall market sentiment, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. This trend is likely to have contributed positively to their Q1 earnings through expanded user growth and associated service fees.

#### 4. **Diversification and Innovation**
   - Coinbase has been diversifying its product offerings, including staking, custody services, and institutional investment solutions. These services contribute to a more stable revenue stream, balancing the volatility of transaction fees. The introduction and management of ETFs are part of this strategic diversification, likely enhancing the company's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.

#### 5. **Regulatory and Strategic Positioning**
   - Amidst increasing discussions around cryptocurrency regulations, Coinbase's proactive approach to compliance and its established position as a regulated entity in various jurisdictions could be seen as a competitive advantage. This positioning reassures investors and users, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs trustworthiness and user base, further impacting its Q1 performance positively.

#### 6. **Broader Economic Indicators**
   - The overall increase in digital asset trading volumes across various exchanges, as seen in the provided chart, suggests a robust period for the crypto market. As one of the leading exchanges, Coinbase is likely to have capitalized on this trend, enhancing its market share and revenue during this period.

### Conclusion
Coinbase's Q1 earnings are positioned to reflect a strong quarter, driven by increased trading volumes, the successful introduction and management of new ETF products, strategic market positioning, and a broadening of its financial services. Investors may look forward to a positive earnings report, underscoring the company's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment."

4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)
5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)

7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem
8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation
9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth
10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states
11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago
12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars
13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)
14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer
15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization
16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift
17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique
18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price
19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream
20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen
21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore
22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected
23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla
24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead."

I feel obligated to post this after reading through a few threads and being shocked at the misinformation in this sub.

I believe Tesla is at the cusp of solving autonomous driving. I'll go over some of the points that people are not considering/misunderstanding in the following text.

""They've been doing this for years and it's still nothing more than advanced cruise control."" This misses a huge detail. FSD V12 is fundamentally a different architecture from all previous versions. V11 had 300k + C programming, V12 has removed all of this, shifting the approach to an end-to-end solution. This has always been the endpoint; end-to-end is scalable and easily trained, it learns by itself instead of being programmed by limited humans. Tesla is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA's GPUs, Elon Musk tweeted a month ago (see image attached) that compute is no longer a bottleneck. You could claim Elon is just lying but the proof is in the pudding. FSD V12 has been having a steady and fast update release schedule. We are now in V12.3.4 after several updates. The fact that the software shifted to fully self-learning AI means now you just need two things: data (good diversity, non-simulated, and proprietary data) and compute. Compute doesn't seem to be a current bottleneck so let's see how the data is looking.

Take a look at the image attached showing miles driven while using FSD. Data that falls under this category is important as interventions are one of the most important data types; it allows you to see the difference between what the software would've done and where the human disagrees. It's straightforward to see why this is invaluable. As you can see, this graph represents an obvious exponential growth, and it isn't slowing down in the upcoming months. Half the eligible fleet (US and Canada) still hasn't got/downloaded the free month trial. Subscription cost just lowered to $99 a month from $200. People on Twitter are overwhelmingly impressed and shocked at the quality. Whoever has the software, I ask you to give it a test drive again if you weren't impressed at first and you'll be shocked.

This amount of data coupled with the compute Tesla has, gives the company a SIGNIFICANT advantage in the pursuit of creating a generalized driving solution that is scalable. Tesla has 6 million+ vehicles collecting millions of frames of data a day. No one else has this much access to real-world relevant data, no one. Rivalling Tesla on compute is also extremely expensive, and without the data to train it, it makes no financial sense.

Don't sleep on Tesla, I've never seen such a mismatch of sentiment vs technology in my life.

461,Depressing Story to Figure out,wallstreetbets,Broadridge Financial Solutions,0,24,10-04-2024 02:21:35,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1c0agq4,"So, I don‚Äôt really like Reddit and I have concerns with r/wallstreetbets (you guys are fucking disturbing to watch) but there was this company I was going to meme post here as a ‚Äújoke‚Äù investment I made into them as I thought they were simply ‚Äúbad‚Äù (balance sheet and financial statements looked a little embarrassing initially) but I went to their website and did a little bit of digging and I can only say that I feel a bit bad for the owner of it and the workers too. The company I‚Äôm talking about is ‚ÄúGreenwave Technology solutions.‚Äù At first I was going to make a bait thread where I fucking edited the price of the stock out and only showed how many shares I owned and once you guys searched up the ticker symbol you‚Äôd fucking laugh your asses off or something lol. But while I was reading their financial statements I did get a bit curious about them, they had less than 10 thousand dollars in net revenues a couple years back, and were taking some serious financial losses even then. It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner, this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do, especially when shit hits the fan, so yeah, I respected that a lot. The company is a small business, it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market, neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them, thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, especially after corona.

COIN has followed BTC price which is fair. However,  I feel like no one acknowledges or may not know: 
1) they gained market share from binance when Binance‚Äôs CZ went to jail in January
2) with the etfs, who do they think is onboarding these etfs new billions and charging them fees? Even if it‚Äôs transferred money from grayscale, new ETFs gotta onboard fiat. Coinbase is proprietor for 8 of 11 BTC ETFs
3) retail use gotta be up, hell im using them sometimes again in spite of high fees
4) does anyone on wallstreet even know about coin‚Äôs defi network Base? Its activity with new memes amongst the defi community is huge, and its fees are high, true to Coinbase

If I am wrong, then I will wake up May 3rd broken, and tell my wife I am regarded. She will nod, knowingly yet not unlovingly, and literally nothing in my marriage will have changed.

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

470,Best ways to give yourself odds,wallstreetbets,Cadence Design Systems,117,115,06-04-2024 13:41:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxbvb0/best_ways_to_give_yourself_odds/,"It's very common for people to call day traders ""gamblers"", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. 

It only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). 

So, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet, place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. The more hands a gambler plays, the more likely they are to walk out with financial losses (bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49... = CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DRUNK AS SHIT AND YOUR MONEY IS ALL GONE!). 

The stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. 

Say a strategy gives 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). A trader would likely never have such excessive drawdown in their account that they'd be out of the game, and moreso as the percent of risk per their account shrinks. 

For instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. 

Sometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. Say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. 

What about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and buy a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move past the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).

Of course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. 

Just a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. 

Trading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. 

It's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner. 

Anyways, to those who read this far -- toodles! And good luck! üëç Share your personal favorite strategy/setup that works best for you if you will. "

Artificial intelligence and robotics are advancing rapidly, and it's crucial to consider how these technologies will disrupt the job market and impact various industries and stocks. While there's plenty of debate about the timing and extent of these disruptions, let's focus our discussion on how to position our investment portfolios in the hypothetical scenario where these disruptions do occur. This post isn't about arguing whether or not these events will happen; instead, we're exploring potential investment strategies based on the assumption that they would. 

To facilitate a more focused discussion and elicit more precise insights, I have outlined three aspects, allowing us to explore investment strategies tailored to these specific circumstances:

* **Aspect 1:** White-Collar Wipeout üëîüíº Mass layoffs of white-collar jobs within the next 2-5 years due to AI and AI Agents. Which stocks should you be betting on now, and which ones are destined for the red? üìâ

* **Aspect 2:** Blue-Collar Bot Takeover ü¶æüè≠ As robotics becomes more sophisticated and affordable, repetitive and simple blue-collar jobs could be on the chopping block. Where should you invest to capitalize on this shift, and which stocks should be avoided? 

* **Aspect 3:** AI is already showing promising prospects in fields like drug discovery, materials science, and beyond, potentially undermining the patent monopolies held by industry giants across various sectors. We're talking cutting-edge advancements like AI-assisted protein synthesis, novel material design, and more! In a world where AI can accelerate innovation and level the playing field, which stocks and markets could emerge as winners, and which might struggle to maintain their dominance? 

*Again this is not a debate about the likelihood or timeline of these scenarios. We're here to discuss investment strategies and identify the potential winners and losers in each case.*

So, share your insights, predictions, and top stock picks for each scenario. Together, we can navigate the uncharted waters and emerge with portfolios that are built to last! üí™üìà

472,NYCB Terrible Earnings,wallstreetbets,Capital One,2,12,01-05-2024 11:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chk4un/nycb_terrible_earnings/,"Earnings just released and it isn‚Äôt pretty. So recently to save the bank from failing shareholder got diluted 70%+ with more dilution on the horizon via warrants. That dilution itself would be sufficient explanation for its current price. Instead they posted an all time terrible 4q2023 earnings. 

Well 1q2024 is in and it‚Äôs bad. Excluding write downs losses accelerated from 187 million to 327 million q/q or a jump of 75%. I guess all of that dilution saves you so eps is only a loss of 45c share.  Worst of all that‚Äôs a loss of 45c per share after selling their best loans meaning losses next quarter are almost guaranteed to be worse. Net interest income down 16% q/q. Net interest margin down 54 basis points q/q (that‚Äôs a 20% NIM drop in a single quarter). 27% Revenue drop q/q and 76.2% drop y/y.   Non interest income went from 127M last quarter to 9M this quarter. Non performing loans jumped 86.5% q/q. Allowance for credit losses jumped 21% q/q.

Overall these are terrible numbers but to have this bad of a q/q results after an all time bad quarter is scary so they need to show those losses decelerating very soon otherwise anymore capital flight and they could go under. I don‚Äôt personally expect them to fail but if you have shares I‚Äôd use any low volume pre market pump to get out. This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze opportunity and they just proved the road to meeting even yesterday‚Äôs valuation is probably over 2 years away. Be wary I‚Äôve seen plenty of big pops on earnings before the market opens evaporate when real investors start selling at open.

Edit: One last thought. It to me feels shady that they really rushed this earnings (13 hour notice) into the morning of an fomc meeting. This is most likely because many regionals used the most rosy legally allowable prediction of two rate cuts in their 2024 forward looking statements and I‚Äôm sure Otting wanted to do the same instead of waiting a week or 2 and having to be only able to factor in one or zero. That‚Äôs a huge impact to net interest income. "

Based on the graph you provided showing Exchange Normalized Trade Volume and the context of recent events, here's a bullish thesis for Coinbase regarding their upcoming Q1 earnings report:

### Coinbase Bull Thesis for Q1 Earnings Report

#### 1. **Increased Trading Volume and Revenue**
   - The graph indicates significant spikes in trading volume from January to March 2024. These periods of high trading volume are critical because they directly correlate with increased transaction fees, which are a primary revenue source for Coinbase. Given the substantial peaks, especially in February and March, Coinbase's revenue from trading fees is likely to have seen considerable growth in Q1.

#### 2. **Introduction of ETFs and Management Role**
   - The introduction of cryptocurrency-related ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) during this quarter, with Coinbase reportedly managing most of them, presents a significant growth opportunity. ETFs attract both retail and institutional investors, broadening Coinbase's customer base. Management of these ETFs not only generates management fees but also boosts trading volumes on the platform, further increasing transaction-based revenues.

#### 3. **Market Sentiment and Adoption**
   - The heightened activity and spikes in the normalized trade volume suggest increased market adoption and interest in cryptocurrencies. As a leading platform, Coinbase benefits from higher overall market sentiment, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. This trend is likely to have contributed positively to their Q1 earnings through expanded user growth and associated service fees.

#### 4. **Diversification and Innovation**
   - Coinbase has been diversifying its product offerings, including staking, custody services, and institutional investment solutions. These services contribute to a more stable revenue stream, balancing the volatility of transaction fees. The introduction and management of ETFs are part of this strategic diversification, likely enhancing the company's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.

#### 5. **Regulatory and Strategic Positioning**
   - Amidst increasing discussions around cryptocurrency regulations, Coinbase's proactive approach to compliance and its established position as a regulated entity in various jurisdictions could be seen as a competitive advantage. This positioning reassures investors and users, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs trustworthiness and user base, further impacting its Q1 performance positively.

#### 6. **Broader Economic Indicators**
   - The overall increase in digital asset trading volumes across various exchanges, as seen in the provided chart, suggests a robust period for the crypto market. As one of the leading exchanges, Coinbase is likely to have capitalized on this trend, enhancing its market share and revenue during this period.

### Conclusion
Coinbase's Q1 earnings are positioned to reflect a strong quarter, driven by increased trading volumes, the successful introduction and management of new ETF products, strategic market positioning, and a broadening of its financial services. Investors may look forward to a positive earnings report, underscoring the company's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment."

I am also too regarded to input  images. This is my first post ever. Please be gentle fellow regards. **THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PLAY. Only shares atm.** 

Do you remember the housing market crash in 2008? Me neither! Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship through the FHFA since September 2008. [This article](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2)  written in 2022 is part 2 of a well written future outlook for the two  mortgage lending giants that were on the front lines during the 2008  housing crash. As I understand it, in order for the two companies to  escape from the conservatorship, they must first raise enough capital to  IPO, which is a massive undertaking. However, things are slowly looking  up. In 2019 the Trump administration authorized the two companies to  start building capital again by accruing retained earnings. Their  combined equity is cresting 100 billion. [It is thought that for both companies to IPO, a combined 150 billion dollars in capital would be required](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2),  which is thought to be massive for an IPO. I believe these two  companies are in for massive gains in the upcoming years as they  continue to rebuild their coffers and potentially exit conservatorship.

  

But don't take my  word for it. Do a one year chart comparison of  the two companies (I would have included that, but I am so god damn  regarded). You might notice that things started to pick up around August  of 2023. I did some digging to find out what was going on around that  time, and lo and behold, [a  federal jury ruled in favor $FMCC and $FNMA, stating that the sweeping  of all their profits into the US treasury due to an amended stock  purchase agreement in 2012 was unconstitutional.](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/bsf-prevails-at-trial-in-decade-long-battle-against-fhfa.html) 

&#x200B;

These two companies are in control of \~**7 trillion dollars worth of assets (**[$FNMA](https://companiesmarketcap.com/fannie-mae/total-assets/#google_vignette) [$FMCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090423A)) combined. I have no idea what that means, but those are pretty big  numbers right? Too big to fail, in fact? One might think....   

With the housing market going crazy, [and a potential Trump win which would be highly favorable for FNMA and FMCC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/a-trump-reelection-seen-as-bullish-for-fannie-freddie-shares),  these are two stocks that I think we should all have our eyes on, as  they seem fairly undervalued at the moment. People have forgotten about  them, and they shouldn't.   

[Here is an excellent interview transcript from the CEO of Fannie Mae, Priscilla Almodovar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceo-fannie-mae-believes-100000781.html).  She is a relatively new CEO (2022 instated) as is the CEO of Freddie  Mac for that matter. She speaks very optimistically about the road ahead  for FNMA, and discusses the lessons learned over the past 15 years. [There](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/fannie-mae-ceo-discusses-government-conservatorship-of-gse) [are](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230137-anticipation-grows-for-end-of-gse-conservatorship?v=preview) [so many god damn](https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/Fannie_Mae_Envisions_Independence_from_Government_Control.aspx) [paywalled  articles from this year or last year in which the CEO and important  people are talking about the end of conservatorship](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230116-the-gses-have-been-profitable-since-2012-maybe-its-time-to-end-the-conservatorships?v=preview). So annoying.   

Options are not available for these two companies (maybe that has  something to do with the conservatorship, I have no idea), but the  shares I believe are extremely undervalued for what they could become  down the road. Please don't take this as advice.   

I have $2000 invested in both $FNMA and $FMCC for a total of $4000  because that's what I can afford right now. I would share a picture, but  the insert image button is not working.  "
475,This is the top before the crash,wallstreetbets,Capital One,810,451,19-04-2024 20:35:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c87782/this_is_the_top_before_the_crash/,"Imagine you‚Äôre a hedge fund and your main motivation is profit (an unfamiliar concept in this sub) and you know that Powell is full of shit, but the market hasn‚Äôt priced that in yet - it is quite literally a classic game of prisoner‚Äôs dilemma. 

You cash out too soon and you miss out on those sweet-sweet tendies. You cash out too late and you‚Äôre filling out an application at Wendy‚Äôs. 

What we saw today was a major shift in sentiment among market makers. What should‚Äôve been a rebound off of the good news that neither Iran or Israel actually tried to inflict damage on one another, resulted in a steady crash across the market, with more markets makers net short than long for the first time in months. 

It‚Äôs only retail investors left who are net long than short and the MM‚Äôs are going to capitalize on this to profit off of us.

Given that earnings season is coming up (currently there is a black out period for orgs where they cannot participate in stock buy backs), there will be a boost driven by companies buying stock in the coming weeks before a sharp decline driven by market makers selling off to retail investors (as they have historically done during high interest rate environments).

Furthermore we see the elevated VIX indicating high volatility which has resulted in market makers reducing every rally we see, and the stocks continuing to drop.

With no interest rates coming this year, MM‚Äôs will continue to sell and short as most companies will fail to grow in a high interest rate environment due to cutbacks.

Only then will be see layoffs that will finally trigger the fed to cut rates. It presently won‚Äôt happen given that there just isn‚Äôt enough capital leaving circulation, and congress quite frankly does not want to do anything about it in the way of taxing it out of the bloated economy.

Hedge funds will act rationally and continue to net sell this year, reducing shareholder value, until they see a reason not to. It‚Äôs up to us to either sell, hedge, or get slaughtered in the process. The choice is yours.

No positions at the moment, just my observation of the markets at this time. I personally would hold cash if you‚Äôre not trading for the long run atm."
476,Palantir ($PLTR): Preview of Possible Massive Commercial Expansion Ahead of Upcoming Earnings - Part 3 - DD,wallstreetbets,Capital One,17,35,17-04-2024 20:05:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6jprd/palantir_pltr_preview_of_possible_massive/,"Palantir has consistently offered robust and sophisticated software solutions, but deployment challenges have previously hindered widespread adoption. Recently, however, the company has introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) product and bootcamp training programs, enabling faster and more streamlined implementation for customers. These initiatives have allowed some clients to emerge from the bootcamps with functional, value-adding products, addressing the deployment bottleneck that had previously constrained Palantir's exponential growth. With these advancements, the company is well-positioned to accelerate adoption and capitalize on the strength of its software offerings. I'm expecting big numbers on May 6th, 2024.

# Previously reported growth rates which were ok:

[Previously Reported Growth Rates](https://preview.redd.it/ilj8y4jpg3vc1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc6fcca44b94923450e6171dce5ccf79798228c)

# Analysis on projected commercial growth:

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies often employ subdomains to isolate and manage their clients' data and resources. By tracking the number of subdomains associated with a SaaS product, one can gain insight into its adoption rate and growth trajectory. Based on my analysis of subdomain data over an extended period, it appears that Palantir, a prominent data analytics firm, is poised for substantial growth in its customer base and market presence.

&#x200B;

[Estimate based on subdomain analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j0qilgg5h3vc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e6f73baf83f97e48ebae61a0f27b3e0593a0af1)

&#x200B;

 

Even if only half of the additions turn into permanent customers these numbers are going to be massive.

**Here is what I used for the source data of subdomain data:**

[https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com)

First, I extracted the data relevant for the analysis‚Äîsubdomains for each snapshot‚Äîand then calculated how many new customers appeared in Q1 2024.

In Q1 2024, Palantir acquired a total of 333 new customers. The monthly breakdown was as follows:

‚Ä¢	January: 81 new customers

‚Ä¢	February: 105 new customers

‚Ä¢	March: 147 new customers

This showed an increasing trend in customer acquisition as the quarter progressed. To forecast the number of new customers for Q2 2024, I used this growth trend. I calculated the monthly growth rates and applied them to predict the number of new customers in the upcoming months of Q2 2024.

For Q2 2024, the projected number of new customers for Palantir, based on the growth rates from Q1 2024, was as follows:

‚Ä¢	April: Approximately 198 new customers

‚Ä¢	May: Approximately 267 new customers

‚Ä¢	June: Approximately 360 new customers

Overall, Palantir was projected to acquire around 826 new customers in Q2 2024. This forecast assumed a consistent growth rate similar to what was observed in Q1 2024. Keep in mind, actual results may vary depending on market conditions, company strategy, and external factors.

477,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Capital One,219,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Mods ban me permanently from this sub if this doesn‚Äôt go to $40 by July 12. !banbet ALCC $40 7/12/2024.

Clean energy + Sam Altman. That is literally the only thing that matters in all of this. Stop overthinking all of the variables. Literally nothing matters in the current market outside of hype.

S-4/A filed yesterday - what that means? Couldn‚Äôt tell you. But you know that guy who created that little tiny thing CHAT FREAKING GPT??? Sam Altmans name is all over this.

‚ÄúOn September 14, 2023, AltC filed a definitive proxy statement (the ""Extension Proxy Statement"") with the SEC in connection with its solicitation of proxies for a special meeting of AltC's shareholders (the ""Special Meeting""), which further describes the proposal to amend AltC's amended and restated certificate of incorporation, in the form set forth in Annex A to the Extension Proxy Statement, to extend the date by which AltC must consummate a merger, capital stock exchange, asset acquisition, stock purchase, reorganization or similar business combination with one or more businesses, which we refer to as a ""business combination"" from October 12, 2023 to July 12, 2024.‚Äù

The merger is planned to happened some time before July 12 or investors will get back ~$10.43/share. 

‚ÄúMr. Altman also (a) has an economic interest in 6,035,600 AltC founder shares and 700,100 AltC private placement shares through his ownership of a membership interest in the Sponsor (but does not beneficially own any shares of AltC capital stock), (b) beneficially owns 519,858 shares of Oklo Series A-3 preferred stock held by Hydrazine Capital II, L.P., and (c) has an economic interest in i) the 252,605 shares of Oklo common stock held by Y Combinator S2014, LLC, (ii) the 354,177 shares of Oklo Series A-1 preferred stock held by YC Holdings II, LLC and (iii) the 55,135 shares of Oklo Series A-2 preferred stock held by YCVC Fund I‚Äù

I don‚Äôt know math so can‚Äôt tell you the exact number but Sam has hundreds of thousands (or MILLIONS?) of shares in this. So I would think he‚Äôd want to see this company do well.

Oh yeah did I mention this is the guy that created chat gpt? That thing that even your great grandmother and taxi driver is talking about? Yeah that guy.

TLDR - Samuel Harris Altman. ALCC to $40 by July or bye bye me.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

480,Bullish on Starbucks,wallstreetbets,Capital One,23,81,08-04-2024 21:13:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bz9mhz/bullish_on_starbucks/,"We all know Starbucks, the giant coffee brand with its ubiquitous stores attracting many white girls. While a P/E ratio of 23 might seem high, I recently invested in Starbucks for reasons that go beyond just the numbers.

One key factor is the addictive nature of coffee and the fast consumption of Starbucks' products. This constant cycle keeps customers coming back for more. Additionally, the brand itself, its name recognition, and the inviting atmosphere of its stores are valuable assets that contribute significantly to future revenue streams.

Now, let's delve into the numbers. Starbucks boasts an impressive 25% Sustainable ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) and a healthy average operating margin of 15.5%. Interestingly, despite being a well-established franchise, Starbucks continues to expand at a steady pace, opening roughly 6% new stores annually. This highlights their significant growth potential.

Looking geographically, Starbucks has plenty of room for international expansion. In the US, there's one store per 35,000 people, while Europe has one per 298,000. China boasts one per 20,000, and India has just one per 5.3 million. These figures demonstrate the vast untapped market potential Starbucks possesses. The company's goal of reaching 55,000 stores by 2030 reflects their commitment to further growth.

To assess Starbucks' intrinsic value, I constructed a free cash flow discount model. My assumptions include:

* Revenue growth of 8% with a 32% reinvestment rate until 2030.
* Subsequent 12 years of revenue growth at 4% with a 25% reinvestment rate, acknowledging the potential for slower growth as the company matures.
* Long-term, sustainable growth of 2%.
* Operating margin improvement from 15.5% to 20%.
* Tax rate increase from 25% to 32% to account for potential future government regulations.
* Discount rate of 6%, based on the average US government bond return.

Based on this model, my calculated intrinsic value for Starbucks is $112 per share.

Overall, Starbucks' strong financial performance, combined with their substantial growth potential, makes them a compelling investment opportunity. My valuation model incorporates realistic assumptions, making a strong case for Starbucks' long-term success.

1. Competition, other insolvent banks could shed light on their insolvency
2. New regulations intended to prevent bank failures
3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid

Here is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:

  
They lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. ""Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December¬†31, 2023, and December¬†31, 2022, respectively.""

On competition:

""The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.""

... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...

Regulation

""Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies.

Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.""

... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...

Them a bank and don't have money

""We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

I don't want to start a panic. If this bank doesn't fail, we are a lot more fucked than we think we are because it absolutely should. My price target is $.0001. I have the ""courage"" to buy every put you write me at $2.5 so let's do this.

482,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,Capital One,8720,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."

However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

485,Entain Stock Primed for Growth,wallstreetbets,Capital One,0,3,04-04-2024 12:05:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvlf8l/entain_stock_primed_for_growth/,"Dear Forum Members,

Today, I want to highlight the compelling case for investing in Entain stock (LSE: ENT) and why it holds significant potential for substantial growth in the near future.

Entain‚Äôs presence in the European market is poised to receive a significant boost this year, thanks to two major sporting events: the UEFA European Football Championship and the Olympic Games. These events command massive attention across Europe, translating into a surge in sports betting activity. Entain, with its substantial market share in Europe, is well-positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for betting services. With sports events gradually returning to their regular schedule, we can anticipate a surge in revenue for Entain, as it leverages its stronghold in the sports betting sector.

Moreover, let‚Äôs delve into the low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of Entain, which stands at just 12.62 for 2025, according to Finanzen.net. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued relative to its earnings, making it an attractive investment opportunity. As investors, this presents an opportunity to acquire Entain shares at a relatively low valuation, with the potential for significant upside as the company continues to grow its revenue and profitability.

Another aspect worth considering is the growth potential of Entain‚Äôs subsidiary, BetMGM, in the burgeoning U.S. sports betting market. With the gradual liberalization of sports betting regulations across various states in the U.S., BetMGM stands to benefit significantly. The company has been making strategic investments and partnerships to strengthen its position in this lucrative market, positioning itself as a key player poised for substantial growth in the coming years. In February BetMGM signed an exclusive Betting Partnership with X, which will lead to further growth in the US in near-term. 

Furthermore, there's speculation surrounding a potential reacquisition of Entain by MGM Resorts International, driven by the current low stock price of Entain. This lower valuation might prompt Entain to consider strategic options to create value for its shareholders. One such option could involve selling its 50% stake in BetMGM, as Entain might feel pressured to enhance shareholder value amidst the low stock price. This scenario adds an intriguing dimension to Entain's stock outlook, as it navigates the possibility of strategic moves to unlock shareholder value amidst changing market dynamics. While these possibilities remain speculative, they underscore the importance of monitoring Entain's strategic decisions in light of its current valuation and market conditions.

In conclusion, Entain‚Äôs stock presents a compelling investment opportunity, supported by factors such as its strong position in the European market, low price-to-earnings ratio, growth prospects in the U.S. through BetMGM, and the possibility of a strategic acquisition by MGM Resorts International.

I welcome your thoughts and further discussion on this investment opportunity."
486,Is Canada Goose preparing to sell?,wallstreetbets,Capital One,0,17,04-04-2024 00:52:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bv9tvk/is_canada_goose_preparing_to_sell/,"Hear me out‚Ä¶So Canada Goose recently cut 17% of their total workforce. This is the second cut in less than a year (last cut August 2023)

They have impressive YoY revenue growth from an increase in store count, strong sales from existing locations, high direct to consumer growth (including online sales). Goose‚Äôs revenue performance in Asia Pacific is wild compared to North America which is also doing great. All this leads me to believe they are VERY UNDERVALUED. 

Goose has an aggressive growth objective of $3 Billion in sales by 2028. Their forward P/E ratio as of today is 9.54 and without NRI 16.16. If you look at LVMH and Hermes forward P/E, they trade at 25.55 and 52.36 as of today. Gooses current market cap is now $1.52 billion (down from $2 billion). They could easily be purchased by one of the big boys (notice LVMH doesn‚Äôt have an outdoor brand). I also learned that Goose may have axed their new travel retail program (opening stores in airports) which was launched last year. Furthermore I‚Äôm seeing Bain Capital leaders being injected into Sr Management for ex: Beth Clymer who was brought in last year as President of Finance, Culture/People, Strategy and Legal (which is a really weird combination of departments under one person). Bain Capital is also their biggest shareholder where she was EVP  and her title still says Private Equity Operating Partner. They‚Äôve hired BCG to oversee a transformation and seems like they‚Äôre about to rebrand given their new product lines.

CONCLUSION:
They have consistent and strong sales growth, expansion plans, bolstered leadership, diversifying their product line (shoes, hats, summer and spring wear etc) and IMO they trade at a major discount. These cuts are telling me they are shedding the fat and maybe preparing for a sale.

Background:
I‚Äôve been in Automotive Sales for 4+ years. 
I have been in sales, finance and insurances.

2020-2023: If you work in the business then you recall during this time you could not even buy a lot of cars from auction due to getting outbid by Carvana and Carmax. They would go 1000-1500 over retail book value which already sets them back if they want to have volume based pricing. 

Carvana stated they averaged $6432 per copy. Now either they are straight up committing forcible sodomy on way too many people or they are full of üí©. I‚Äôm leaning towards the üí©. 

The average dealership should run 3000 a copy split between the front and back. A great dealership will run 4000-4500 a copy between the front and back. The front gross is determined by the sale of the vehicle and the back gross is your finance and insurances. 

Here is the catch. Book data on cars is still rough. Buying cars from the auction is STILL rough. Dealers are still paying a fair share of money just to acquire used cars. Carmax who is the number one automotive group in the country didn‚Äôt even put those numbers up. Yet Carvana is magically the highest grossing store per unit in the entire country. 

I‚Äôm considering going into a short position because this has fraud written all over it.

488,Mercedes level 3 vs tesla level 2 here‚Äôs why Tesla will be a big winner,wallstreetbets,CarMax,0,134,28-04-2024 03:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ceweuo/mercedes_level_3_vs_tesla_level_2_heres_why_tesla/,"I‚Äôve seen in wsb the misinformation on how Tesla fsd is a joke, it will take another 20 yrs, Elon is a liar & keep telling Mercedes is level 3 autonomy, superior to Tesla

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let‚Äôs go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here‚Äôs the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, üêª open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won‚Äôt go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can‚Äôt make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

489,$CVNA: Sky-High Valuation Is a House of Cards,wallstreetbets,CarMax,22,20,04-04-2024 17:31:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvt7yg/cvna_skyhigh_valuation_is_a_house_of_cards/,"Carvana (CVNA) is significantly overvalued, with a strong case for an imminent decline in share price.

**Unsustainable Valuation:** Carvana's valuation at $19 billion, representing a 49x EV/2024E EBITDA multiple, is deemed absurd and unsustainable, especially given the company's mixed 4Q23 results and underwhelming growth outlook. This valuation places Carvana at a premium not just relative to auto dealers but also leading tech companies, despite lacking comparable growth prospects or profitability. To reach the current stock price, it's not just necessary for EBITDA per unit to double, but also for vehicle sales and revenue to increase at an improbable compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 18% over a period of seven years.

**Profitability and Growth Concerns:** Despite efforts to improve profitability to mitigate balance sheet crises, Carvana's growth is challenged. The anticipation for a return to meaningful growth is contradicted by a mere ""slight"" unit growth projection for 1Q24, signaling that profitability enhancements may be nearing their limits.

**Comparison with CarMax:** Carvana's operational metrics, particularly gross profit per retail unit (GPU), have plateaued, reaching levels consistent with CarMax but without exhibiting any remarkable edge over the industry leader. This comparison undermines Carvana's positioning as a disruptor in the auto retail sector. As former Carvana executives said, the company is ""just a dealership. 

**Operational Inefficiencies and Market Misconceptions:** Carvana's operational efficiencies and market positioning, suggesting that the company's past growth was achieved by overlooking fundamental industry practices rather than through disruptive innovation. Carvana's improvement strategies, especially in vehicle reconditioning and logistics, largely mimic those of CarMax, challenging the narrative of Carvana as a unique tech-driven entity.

**Growth Versus Profitability Dilemma:** Carvana faces a dilemma between pursuing aggressive growth and maintaining profitability. The operational and strategic shifts required for growth could compromise the company's recent profitability achievements, a risk exacerbated by the tight job market and supply constraints in the used vehicle sector.

**Valuation and Price Target:** The price target of $16, a 77% decline from current levels, is based on a 12x multiple to their estimated 2026E EBITDA, aligning Carvana's valuation more closely with CarMax and reflecting the operational and financial realities facing Carvana.

RCL has nearly double the earnings/double the debt and 30% more shares. NCLH has 20% more earnings, double the debt and 2.3 more share out. CCL has the same earnings, triple the debt and double the shares outstanding.

**Royal Caribbean**: has a market cap of $37.4b an enterprise value of $59b or $140 a share. It projects to earn $11 (likely to beat). RCL had $11b of debt before COVID and $3.4b of EBITDA with $21.4b of debt. This year it should have $6.2b.

**Carnival:** has a market cap of $21b (using 1.4b share count), an enterprise value of $52b. It projects to earn 98 cents. CCL had $11.2b of debt before COVID and $5.6b of EBITDA. and $32b of debt

**NCLH**: has a market cap of $9.8b, and an enterprise value of $24b. It projects to earn $1.23 this year. NCLH had $6.8b of debt before covid and $1.8b of EBITDA. This year it has $14b of debt.

**Valuation Metrics**

RCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.5  
RCL: Current PE 11.67

CCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.3  
CCL: PE ratio of 15

NCLH Enterprise value to EBITDA of 10.9  
NCLH: 15.4 PE

The way valuation works is companies with less debt should have higher PE‚Äôs. RCL has better growth prospects then these companies and lowering its debt. I know people are confused because NCLH and CCL are still down a lot since COVID. But both companies have a lot more shares outstanding.

RCL has 280m diluted shares vs 209 pre covid

491,IS ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL?,wallstreetbets,Carnival,10,39,24-04-2024 20:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc982d/is_anyone_actually_bullish_about_ccl/,"Is anyone bullish about $CCL??? Honestly, take a look at the fundamentals, the bottom and top lines, and consider its potential for growth.

(Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = üöÄ potential.

Loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of 100+ ships.

Long-term play, potential 5x-10x return.)

I'm bullish about $CCL, and here's why:

First, let's take a look at the fundamentals. Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company, with a market cap of approximately $18.79 billion as of April 24, 2024. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78, indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity. Additionally, $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships, making it a major player in the cruise industry.

Now, let's consider the company's financial performance. In 2023, $CCL reported revenue of $24.5 billion, a significant increase from the $5.6 billion it reported in 2022. This indicates that the travel demand is surging, and $CCL is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

Moreover, $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4, compared to the industry average of 15. This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth.

The company's history also supports a bullish outlook. Before the pandemic, $CCL was a high-flying stock, with a P/E ratio of over 20. While the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, it has since recovered and is now back on track for growth.

Essentially, with a loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of over 100 ships, $CCL is a long-term play with the potential for a 5x-10x return. The surge in travel demand and the company's undervalued stock price make it an attractive investment opportunity."
492,Food for thought - CCL - 5/17 $16c,wallstreetbets,Carnival,27,36,05-04-2024 16:39:21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bwmn4k,"You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôve gathered you all here today. 

CCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B

Around 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.

In 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.

CCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. 

RCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. 



-CON-
CCL‚Äôs long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. 

-HOWEVER-

During last quarter CCL‚Äôs operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. 

CCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, ‚ÄúOur responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders‚Äù

I‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs money to be made here. Love to hear some thoughts on this."

There are several factors that contribute to the belief that Tesla is undervalued as a company. Firstly, Tesla is a pioneer in the electric vehicle industry, which is experiencing significant growth due to increasing environmental concerns and a shift towards sustainable transportation. With their innovative technology and strong market presence, Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. 

Secondly, Tesla has established itself as a leading brand in the automotive industry. Their vehicles are known for their high performance, cutting-edge features, and sleek design, which have garnered a dedicated customer base. This brand recognition and customer loyalty contribute to the company's long-term growth potential.

Furthermore, Tesla's expansion beyond the automotive sector sets it apart from traditional car manufacturers. The company has made significant strides in renewable energy with its solar panels and energy storage solutions. This diversification not only provides additional revenue streams but also positions Tesla as a key player in the broader clean energy market.

Additionally, Tesla's continuous investment in research and development allows them to stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Their commitment to innovation, evidenced by their Autopilot feature and ongoing improvements in battery technology, further strengthens their competitive advantage.

Lastly, the global demand for electric vehicles is expected to rise in the coming years as governments worldwide implement stricter emission regulations and incentives for clean transportation. Tesla's established infrastructure, including Supercharger stations, gives them a competitive edge in meeting this growing demand. "
497,DNUT is the NVDA of fast food,wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,25,68,26-04-2024 22:59:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdz935/dnut_is_the_nvda_of_fast_food/,"Greetings brothers and sisters,

Are you about tired of week after week of losing your closest relatives' land and property making random bets in the stock market? How are those TSLA puts and META calls? I feel your pain, my friends, and since I've felt your and my pain I'm making this DD because I've realized a once in a decade opportunity is upon us. 

I wanna start out with a little back story. When I was in 3rd grade back many years ago, we would have this thing where everyone would bring a treat when it was their birthday. There was this one girl named Karly K (omitting last name for respect, she is now dead from diabetes and premature obesity). Anyways, Karly K and her family absolutely loved donuts. And every year she would have her mom bring the most delicious dish. It was Krispy Kreme donuts sliced in half, buttered, seared in a skillet, then they put a juicy hamburger patty on them. 

Karly K brought these to school every year until she graduated. Not only did she bring them to school, but her and her family were actually selling catering for this dish. It had become extremely popular in the region of Canada I lived in at the time. 

Karly's dad was a custodian at the school and her mother a full-time stay at home mom. They probably lived in the dumpiest home I'd ever seen when she was in 2nd grade. The roof was caved in and when it got cold the only blankets they had were made out of food stamp certificates and Wendy's coupons knitted together that had been passed down for many generations. 

When she graduated this family was probably the richest people in Canada besides Drake. They had a swimming pool, chandeliers all over the place, and Lamborghinis. 

Now, it doesn't take a genius to realize this money was made by their catering business. And that brings me to my main point I want to make today -- DNUT closed the week with a sly 2.16B valuation. McDonald's has about a 200B valuation for comparison. 

Just a few weeks ago these two announced that Krispy Kreme donuts would be sold in pretty much every McDonald's in the US, probably a lot of the global market too, by 2026. 

So do the math with me, guys. If DNUT gets the footprint of a company about 100x bigger than them, does this add value? Yet, today DNUT is just a little bit above where it was before this incredible deal was announced. 

This means to me, that DNUT can probably grow revenue about as fast as NVDA did in the last two years in the next couple years. Possibly even faster. Donuts cost almost nothing to make and people will take out installment loans to buy them, so there's a lot of pricing power and margin in this business that can be exploited AFTER these donuts make their way into these McDonalds restaurants. So conservatively say their revenues and profits expand about 75x in the next 3 years, does this only justify a mere valuation of 1% of McDonald's? Nay!

Indeed, I highly suspect DNUT is worth closer to $150 a share today just on the outlook. And when the macro gets better and interest comes down and stuff, more people will use their credit cards to buy donuts with hamburgers in them at McDonald's. They will command about a 120-150 billion dollar valuation in 2-3 years. This would equate to a share price of about  $700 from today's $13. 

This is why I will be full porting my current Robinhood account and additional money I generate behind the Wendy's dumpster into DNUT stock and long dated call options. A 10,000 dollar investment will be worth like 600k in a couple years if everything works out as I've calculated. 

I've made my decision,  but what do you guys think? D-do or D-not, DNUT?"

The survey highlights growing interest in extended trading hours, particularly among retail investors, who are already able to trade cryptocurrencies and some stocks outside regular hours.

The idea of a 24/7 exchange has gained traction in recent years, driven by the rise of retail investor activity and the availability of other markets, such as US Treasuries and currencies, for trading around the clock. However, institutional interest has been muted due to concerns around liquidity and settlement risk. Some retail brokers already offer 24-hour weekday access to US stocks, but an overnight exchange would require heavy regulatory oversight and approval.

A start-up, 24 Exchange, is seeking SEC approval to launch the first round-the-clock exchange, with the survey coming ahead of a potential decision. The proposal has sparked debate, with some arguing that extended trading hours would benefit investors, while others raise concerns around staffing, settlement, and market stability. As the SEC scrutinizes the plans, the outcome will determine whether the US stock market will follow the lead of other global markets and cryptocurrencies in offering 24/7 trading.

Historically, most of the revenue for bitcoin miners has come from the block rewards, ie the new bitcoin being created by the protocol.  The block rewards were cut in half on 4/20, aka the halvening.  Fees don't make much money for miners:

&#x200B;

[bitcoin fees as a &#37; of total block rewards](https://preview.redd.it/b0ddnytabtvc1.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=34652730f25848f864830e86404ed0115ff0fb95)

As you can see, user fees as a percent of miner revenue has been close to zero for most of bitcoin's history.  Since the block subsidy is being cut in half every four years, the future appears grim for the bitcoin miners.  Wall Street rates them holds or sells.  But what's that historically huge spike we just saw on 4/20?  That, my fellow regards, was caused by the *Runes* protocol, which went live along with the halving.

Long story short, Runes is an attempt to bring NFTs to Bitcoin.  Anyone paying attention to crypto at all the past couple years will know the potential mania that might come with this.  It hints that bitcoin could be a long-term threat to Ethereum, something most analysts don't consider, and it's causing a dramatic surge in demand for bitcoin block space right now.

Here's the realtime bitcoin fee data:

&#x200B;

[recent bitcoin transaction fees intraday](https://preview.redd.it/optlsmkvctvc1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2fcd990ab19a029c3e45e9c23d84460bcafdd58)

You can see that fees per block have moved substantially higher post-halving, compared with the previous week, a period that was already showing elevated user fees compared with bitcoin's history.  The demand for bitcoin block space is increasing exponentially, and this bodes well for bitcoin's future.

$MARA Marathon Digital is the market cap leader in bitcoin mining, and has been very profitable as bitcoin has been going up.  EPS of $1.08 in the past year, low debt to equity, all with bitcoin at prices well below current levels.  Meanwhile, US bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful launch in history.  ETFs were just approved in Hong Kong as well.  Bitcoin will be the world's first global money.  Now with Runes, the narrative that the miners will struggle because nobody actually uses bitcoin will take a serious hit.  So you're going to see three things happening simultaneously in the next quarter:

&#x200B;

1. the bitcoin price is going to rip higher, as high net worth individuals and small companies start allocating assets to bitcoin, following a still-building wave of Wall Street marketing, helped by...
2. ... the anti-bitcoin narrative that miners can't be profitable long-term and therefore the asset security model is broken takes a big hit, since...
3. ... demand for block space will be rising significantly, providing a much rosier outlook for the long-term future of bitcoin miners which will lead to ...
4. ... analyst upgrades, as bitcoin miners will be reporting record earnings due to increased fees and rapidly rising bitcoin price

&#x200B;

With earnings going up AND P/E multiples widening, the upside potential for $MARA is huge.  Now the cherry on top, the grim outlook for miners has created a significant short interest of 18% of the float, \~43 million shares short. 

&#x200B;

[significant short interest in $MARA](https://preview.redd.it/valuc5yritvc1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92dbbbc19aecdf5f262089436e2f269d30289db)

Between a new wave of insane bitcoiners FOMO'ing into NFTs at any price, shorts covering, and legitimately increasing revenue and prospects for the company, imo this one is a firecracker set to pop.

501,"Elon Musk‚Äôs succession at Tesla, who might be next?",wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,474,474,20-04-2024 17:17:26,https://i.redd.it/32tknlo14ovc1.jpeg,"Hello everyone,
In the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.

Elon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:

- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs
- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)
- prices have been lowered again in the üá∫üá∏, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon
- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/
- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)

Zhu in November 2022
The first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/

Here a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/

The CFO in May 2023
The name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7

Both the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)

Since then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict 
- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1
- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason

Of course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:
- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?
- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?
- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? 
- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?

Several articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:
- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html
- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570

504,PARA Thesis - No Deal and No Merger Outlook,wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,21,21,18-04-2024 21:08:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c7ep3z/para_thesis_no_deal_and_no_merger_outlook/,"This thesis builds on continued earnings growth from Q3 and Q4 of 2023. I am anticipating EPS of between $0.75 and $1.00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024. I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect, Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x, while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions, I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line, a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I‚Äôm fairly confident the Skydance deal won‚Äôt be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this,

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall, bullish on Paramount. I think it‚Äôs trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects, David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He‚Äôs also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised, but in my opinion, if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues, would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two, the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall, I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense. It‚Äôs a dramatic story if you have been paying attention. "

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
506,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,211,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

&#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike‚Äîa direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies‚Äîhas marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:

>Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&#x200B;

The market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:

>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in ‚Äî benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran‚Äôs diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.

&#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&#x200B;

On Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers‚Äîthose who rely on oil prices.

So far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.

&#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war‚Äîor the potential of war‚Äîcan move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me."

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside.

A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       

We are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap‚Äôs are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.

512,China is the under-reported factor in the rise of Gold and Silver,wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,107,54,12-04-2024 13:57:07,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c29ti8/china_is_the_underreported_factor_in_the_rise_of/,"It may have come to your attention that the price of gold and silver has increased significantly over the last month.

There has been some reporting on the issue, but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the ""usual suspects"" - geopolitical  tensions (check), reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check), and fears about the banking system (check).

All these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.

Gold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.

It is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.

Since around September of last year, **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently, silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.

Now, price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before, but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)

Arbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.

Markets are carefully, and sometimes tightly, ""managed"" by the Chinese government.

For some reason, they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**,  as miners in South America, Mexico, Poland, South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.

This is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China,  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. 

Raw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note, these are in yuan/kilo, so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).

513,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,41,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

515,$LW Buy the -20% dip with your French fries,wallstreetbets,Cboe Global Markets,71,42,04-04-2024 15:22:55,https://i.redd.it/dfapgg21dhsc1.jpeg,"
LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

*Financials Overview:*
	‚Ä¢	2024 sales projection: $6.88B, increasing to $7.27B in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	Net income expected to rise from $856M in 2024 to $953M in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	P/E ratios indicate fair valuation at 17.1 (2024) and 15.3 (2025).

https://www.marketscreener.com/quote/stock/LAMB-WESTON-HOLDINGS-INC-31862637/

*Market Presence:*
	‚Ä¢	Strong client base including giants like McDonald‚Äôs, Burger King, Wendy‚Äôs and Walmart.
	‚Ä¢	Dominant player in the global frozen potato market.


*ERP System Challenges:*
	‚Ä¢	ERP implementation impacted Q3 results, affecting net income and Adjusted EBITDA.
	‚Ä¢	Short-term operational disruptions and financial impact are notable.

*Risks:*
	‚Ä¢	Immediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.
	‚Ä¢	Client dependency could pose strategic risks.

*Outlook:*
	‚Ä¢	Despite short-term challenges, particularly with the ERP system, long-term prospects remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Solid customer relationships and financial health suggest LW is a viable long-term investment.


Additional analysis:
‚ÄúUpdated Fiscal 2024 Outlook
	‚Ä¢	Net sales of $6.54 billion to $6.60 billion
	‚Ä¢	GAAP net income of $770 million to $790 million, and Diluted EPS of $5.30 to $5.45
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted EBITDA(2) of $1,480 million to $1,510 million, which includes a temporary, higher-than-expected impact from the transition to a new ERP system in North America and a $96 million pre-tax charge(1) for the write-off of excess raw potatoes
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted Net Income(2) of $800 million to $820 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) of $5.50 to $5.65‚Äù

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.


I dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we‚Äôre on wsb bay bay. Also I‚Äôm a regard and bought too early in the dip. I probably should have waited until things calm down a bit. But I‚Äôm gonna hold regardless. GLHF

516,$SPY Correlation With Each Individual S&P 500 Company,wallstreetbets,CDW,13,13,03-05-2024 18:55:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cjgeqq/spy_correlation_with_each_individual_sp_500/,"I used Google Sheets and Apps Script to make a tool that can automatically find the any company's correlation with each individual company in the S&P 500. I figured that something like this could be useful for pairs trading strategies.

https://preview.redd.it/qwvqd799d9yc1.png?width=1719&format=png&auto=webp&s=61393dde701621365978925fd0affc87921e25d9

This is what it looks like on the front end and I have other tabs that are a lot uglier looking and store most of the data. The 3 variables I was most interested in measuring were:

* The correlation between any two stocks
* The slope of the regression line between the stock ratio (Stock 1 / Stock 2) v.s. the amount of elapse time
* The current ratio between two stocks versus their average ratio over a given time frame (I called this Relative to Avg)

Using Apps script, I wrote a simple program that repeatedly plugs in various stock tickers into the ""Stock 2"" box and takes each of the three variables mentioned above. Below I have attached a separate sheet that is the result of a test between $SPY and each of the 503 companies in the S&P 500 over a 180 day time frame.

Results from $SPY 180 day test:¬†[SPY Correlation Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYyDCTUb8KKtBdxcrRAkAIY0vvE3m2kIVnszvcg3Rlg/edit#gid=1003617349)

You might have to make a copy of the Google Sheet, but once you do that, you should be able to use the ""Filter"" table on the right to look for companies that meet a specific correlation, slope, or Relative to Avg threshold.

I don't want to share the link to the actual Google Sheet I use to do all of this because it took quite a bit of time and effort, but if anyone has a specific company and time frame they want me to run the program for, I'd be happy to do that and share something similar to the¬†[SPY Correlation Data](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1cYyDCTUb8KKtBdxcrRAkAIY0vvE3m2kIVnszvcg3Rlg/edit#gid=1003617349)¬†sheet that I linked above.

For Chipotle (CMG),wallstreetbets,Chipotle Mexican Grill,40,73,24-04-2024 17:17:01,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc3uur/hell_is_coming_for_chipotle_cmg/,"CMG has run up 69% since the October 2023 lows, and I believe hedge funds are looking to exit at around this level. Notice the heavy selling on 3/20 once price hit $3000. Looming 50:1 stock split is not until June so no worries about the poors pumping the stock. 

**Catalyst:**
Earnings today after close. As you may know, California recently raised its minimum wage for chain fast food companies to $20/hr, and it just took effect beginning of April. Chipotle has had to raise its prices there (again), and now people are paying $12-15 for a gentrified burrito. With the repeated price increases and the possible staff reductions, Becky might decide to visit an actual Mexican restaurant. California makes up 14% of their locations, so while this will not end their bloodline, I believe they may update their guidance in this earnings call. Whoever the hell is buying at this price is paying out 5-7 years worth of potential growth in advance. 

**Hedge Funds:**
Ackman reduced position in Q4 2023, and it's not yet known if he sold any in Q1 2024 yet because 13F's are not out yet. Maybe that was him on 3/20?

**Potential risks:**

‚Ä¢ Price increases may lead to increased revenue if people don't stop coming in.

‚Ä¢ They may use minimum wage as an excuse to reduce staff, reducing payroll costs to slave drive the shit out of 1 remaining worker behind the counter, leading to possible increased earnings.

‚Ä¢ I am just a regard like you and I have no idea what I'm talking about.

522,Is the growth in trading algorithms responsible for manic-depressive markets?,wallstreetbets,Cisco,2,12,19-04-2024 20:30:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c872jn/is_the_growth_in_trading_algorithms_responsible/,"Today‚Äôs markets seem to cycle between euphoria and depression. 

During the euphoria phase, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see the major indices up 6, 7, 8 trading days in a row, while individual stocks are up 10, 11, 12, 13 days in a row. 

During the depression phase, it‚Äôs the complete opposite: the S&P 500 has sold off for 6 straight days, while many individual stocks e.g. Dave & Buster‚Äôs (PLAY) is down 12 days in a row, and Overstock/Beyond (BYON) has only had 1 green day w/minuscule gain in April thus far, following a 13-day losing streak.

It‚Äôs not just a matter of very high & very low RSI readings, but once the algos identify a trend, they seem to blindly follow it and squeeze out every last penny until they can‚Äôt anymore.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble, ie \~1995‚Äì2002, and to my surprise, this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive, but every few days, the trend would reverse. 

For example, Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3%, 4%, 1%, 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21, 1999, then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up, and on the way down, as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day, algo-driven markets."

The market continues to be a bit skittish, down about 3/4% at the time of writing.  I had positioned for this trade yesterday by NVDA puts that I closed out to open calls that I will cash Monday. Sometimes you can just print money.

The earnings reports show what I've been saying - good earnings will be rewarded and the market will continue to grind higher. Yes, it's a little lower right now, but we'll be higher coming out of this earnings season as companies keep reporting strong results.

The key points:

* JPM, WF, and C all beat earnings expectations
* Only Citigroup (C) stock is up on the reports
* I think JPMorgan (JPM) is a good buying opportunity here

Looking ahead, I expect the ""rate cuts"" narrative to return once the next inflation print comes around.

The bottom line is to keep buying the dips. This market is giving a great opportunity to make money, so take advantage of it.

PS - yet again some folks reaching out to ask where to put money to work.  So here we go:

* Cybersecurity: this is a growth segment that is very cash rich due to high margin business the large businesses operate in. ZS and PANW are good names to buy before their earnings (expect some volatility)
* Large caps will continue to perform better this quarter, but will give way to small caps at some point this year as the interest rate story comes.
* Utilities/ energy are no longer looking attractive, but look for natural gas exposure (EQT is a good name).
* Banks: higher interest rates will benefit larger banks.  Buy JPM!

Lay off of NVDA for a few weeks.  Get out of AMD and stay out."

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

528,Bitcoin Halving and the Brewing Storm in Crypto Mining: A Deep Dive,wallstreetbets,Citizens Financial Group,31,38,18-04-2024 13:41:36,https://i.redd.it/bfq9lfppr8vc1.jpeg,"As most of you know, the Bitcoin halving is due in just a few days. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, is a built-in feature of Bitcoin that reduces the reward for mining new blocks in half. Currently, miners are rewarded 900 BTC per day, but post-halving, this will drop to 450 BTC. With Bitcoin's current valuation, this reward reduction could slash the industry's annual revenue by an estimated $10 billion. That's huge!

Previous halvings have historically led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin, which helped mitigate the reduced mining rewards. However, this time the context is different, and here‚Äôs why:

1. Increased Operational Costs: The mining difficulty has shot up nearly six times since the last halving, driven by a surge in the miner population chasing the same reward pie. Consequently, to stay competitive, miners are forced to invest in more expensive equipment, which is a hefty financial commitment.

2. Energy Cost Competition: Miners are also vying against deep-pocketed Big Tech firms for affordable electricity. These firms are investing heavily in AI and data centers, and utility companies prefer them over crypto miners for their stable financial outlook, leaving miners with higher electricity costs.

Now, here's the kicker. The increased skepticism around the profitability of crypto mining has led traders to place significant short bets against crypto mining stocks. Last I checked, the total short interest for a group of 15 crypto-mining stocks is hovering around $2 billion, representing almost 15% of these companies' available shares. To put that into perspective, it's three times the US market average short interest.

The market seems to be signaling a lack of confidence in the mining industry's ability to cope with the halving and rising operational costs. We're looking at a potential violent move up or a downturn in mining stocks, depending on how the situation unfolds.

530,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,wallstreetbets,Citizens Financial Group,2242,434,15-04-2024 19:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4uddl/donald_trump_is_taking_his_of_djt_todays_resale/,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, chair of the Zodiac Group, which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer, the owner of the Zodiac group, at $24 billion, making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war,‚Äù said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-miscalculation-retaliation.html


No direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?

Regardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran‚Äôs best interest to keep oil prices elevated."

(NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,Citizens Financial Group,20,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not.

The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they‚Äôre expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes.

536,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,CME Group,55,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

Good day fellow degenerates!

Some of you asked me to post an updated photo of my INTC position, but before, a few words. Since my DD, Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed, selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise, surprise, tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again, -8%, lol. Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3% the next day. 

Now, does all of this make sense? In some sense of course, the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years, which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor, Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary, I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor, Ryzen 9. No surprise, Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS, with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using, amongst others, the 20A process, meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process, resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT, GOOG, META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack, getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell, but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs, while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So, you may call me a degenerate idiot, I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However, no time pressure with shares, which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued, literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

543,"Cummins ide me, Daddy: A $9.7 Billion Dollar Gay Bear Tail Thesis (CMI)",wallstreetbets,Cummins,25,28,08-04-2024 01:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bylmq5/cummins_ide_me_daddy_a_97_billion_dollar_gay_bear/,"For those of you regards that are too pussy to YOLO 0DTE SPY puts, you'll love this because a SPY drawdown would cause this theory to execute as well since CMI currently trends closely with the SPY.

First, if you don't know Cummins, they make arguably the best Diesel engines on planet earth. If you're a Suits fan, think McKernon motors, but for Diesel trucks. Historically, they're an incredibly stable company and have been in the business for a longgg time out of Indiana. So why puts?

Well, the first thing that caught my eye, was a MASSIVE lawsuit they just¬†[settled with the EPA to the tune of $1.7 billion](https://apnews.com/article/cummins-doj-settlement-engine-emissions-claims-b80708c6ebe8eb7e7a3684db0837e209)¬†for¬†*allegedly*¬†(absolutely) using emission defeat devices and violating the Clean Air Act. And the promise to recall all one million RAM trucks to make them emission compliant. They've already paid the fine, but the recall costs are still coming in hot. This settlement has opened the flood gates, as they're now getting sued by¬†[shareholders and Dodge Ram truck owners](https://www.therepublic.com/2024/02/19/cummins-faces-shareholder-and-customer-lawsuits-after-2b-settlement/). 

This alone doesn't mean shit for me (although it does add to the Bear case), but there is some fuckery afoot that caused some red flags to rise.

During the midst of all this legal drama, Cummins has finalized a full separation from their sister company,¬†[Atmus Filtration](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2024/02/14/cummins-launches-exchange-offer-separation-atmus-filtration-technologies). This dissolution and subsequent stock exchange program for Cummins investors¬†[finalized on MARCH 13th, 2024](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318925736/en/Cummins-Announces-Final-Results-of-Exchange-Offer-and-Finalizes-Separation-of-Atmus-Filtration-Technologies-Inc).

Why is that important? Well, I'm not entirely sure how much revenue/influence Atmus had on Cummins stock, but apparently this decision impacted hedge fund sentiments in a very big way. Here's the¬†[SI on CMI](https://fintel.io/ss/us/cmi)¬†from August through March:

[32,498,522 Shares is a $9,771,330,609 short investment at current price](https://preview.redd.it/vuxe99yds5tc1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=04739ca4795079bab4e6aeca00851152e05b19e7)

Remember that the first article to finalize dissolution was February 14th, where we see a bump from 1,983,145 to 3,231,342 SI, just a casual 63% increase. But what's remarkable is that once the dissolution is finalized in March the SI jumps to 32,498,522, or 24% of the Float. This is a 1,529% increase from January 31st!!

This is fascinating because the company has actually outperformed the SPY, even since that date. I may be a smooth brain, but knowing that the price was \~$270 mid march, that means shorts are currently looking at a billion++ dollar loss if the price stays at $300+.

So why now? Earnings.

CMI earnings date is 4/30/24 and this is their first earnings since the new lawsuits, the Atmus dissolution finalization, and their guidance during Q4 literally stated they expect a drop in revenue between 2-5% just from market forces, not even considering these other factors. They've also had declining EPS for four straight quarters, yet their expected EPS is $5.11, a number they've only beat ONCE in the last decade. Definitely feels like analysts are setting them up to fail so the rug pull can be explained.

This just¬†***feels***¬†like insider trading/knowledge of either more Government hits; lawsuits; or Atmus Filtration dissolution implications that laymen don't understand. Whatever it is, I'm tailing the big money on this one. Wish me luck, regards!

TL;DR - Big money going gay bear mode Cumming(s) all over an engine company that just got dodge Rammed by the EPA, no filter.

544,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,CVS Health,42,32,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

545,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,CVS Health,22,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

546,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Delta Air Lines,126,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

The company, which released its first Macs with M3 chips five months ago, is already nearing production of the next generation ‚Äî the M4 processor ‚Äî according to people with knowledge of the matter. The new chip will come in at least three main varieties, and Apple is looking to update every Mac model with it, said the people, who asked not to be identified because the plans haven‚Äôt been announced.

549,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",wallstreetbets,Delta Air Lines,287,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Positions:

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

552,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Discover Financial,200,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

Tell me how to make money on this, looking to short US steel industry. 

Commercial construction general contractor here. Just awarded a multi-million dollar job to a reputable Mexican fabricator. They undercut my favorite (and historically cheapest) guy by 38%, apples to apples. I‚Äôve been doing this for ten years, this has NEVER happened before. A few weeks before a friend/client called me to vet a bid he received from another GC (we did not bid the job), similar situation, different fabricator but Mexican. 

I know what you‚Äôre thinking‚Ä¶ labor? Maybe, but not that much. We‚Äôre talking a delta of ~$1M.

Either way, the US steel industry is about to get ROCKED if the tariff bill fails. Which, it probably will because congress is useless at this point.

554,"For you weak paperhands, who actually managed to lose money this week, CPNG may be your last chance",wallstreetbets,Dollar General,15,38,26-04-2024 22:44:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdyxbo/for_you_weak_paperhands_who_actually_managed_to/,"So after 6 straight days of red, and caving into your FOMO self, you chose **this** week to be a bear?

Look, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I‚Äôll let you in on some of my cooking üç≥

Okay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.

For all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. üí∞x10

The fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. üåï üöÄ

For the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. üß†üí°

Let‚Äôs Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:

I‚Äôm not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

https://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20

**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b

Next is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.

\*\*Terminal Value (TV)\*\*= FCF2033 √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r ‚Äì g) = US$3.7b√ó (1 + 2.3%) √∑ (7.1%‚Äì 2.3%) = US$79b

\*\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\*\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b√∑ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b

Crunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billionüí∞üí∞üí∞

Now, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.

Compared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! üìà

Now, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don‚Äôt make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.

So, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.

TLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy‚Äôs while the rest of us count our tendies üí∞üçü

Positions: 10 x 28c 6/21 üöÄüí∞

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

*Financials Overview:*
	‚Ä¢	2024 sales projection: $6.88B, increasing to $7.27B in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	Net income expected to rise from $856M in 2024 to $953M in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	P/E ratios indicate fair valuation at 17.1 (2024) and 15.3 (2025).

*Market Presence:*
	‚Ä¢	Strong client base including giants like McDonald‚Äôs, Burger King, Wendy‚Äôs and Walmart.
	‚Ä¢	Dominant player in the global frozen potato market.


*ERP System Challenges:*
	‚Ä¢	ERP implementation impacted Q3 results, affecting net income and Adjusted EBITDA.
	‚Ä¢	Short-term operational disruptions and financial impact are notable.

*Risks:*
	‚Ä¢	Immediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.
	‚Ä¢	Client dependency could pose strategic risks.

*Outlook:*
	‚Ä¢	Despite short-term challenges, particularly with the ERP system, long-term prospects remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Solid customer relationships and financial health suggest LW is a viable long-term investment.


Additional analysis:
‚ÄúUpdated Fiscal 2024 Outlook
	‚Ä¢	Net sales of $6.54 billion to $6.60 billion
	‚Ä¢	GAAP net income of $770 million to $790 million, and Diluted EPS of $5.30 to $5.45
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted EBITDA(2) of $1,480 million to $1,510 million, which includes a temporary, higher-than-expected impact from the transition to a new ERP system in North America and a $96 million pre-tax charge(1) for the write-off of excess raw potatoes
	‚Ä¢	Adjusted Net Income(2) of $800 million to $820 million and Adjusted Diluted EPS(2) of $5.50 to $5.65‚Äù

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

Why is that? is it because the globalists continue to repeat ad nauseum that water is not a human right? ya maybe.

&#x200B;

Or is it because water is only part of what ECL does? did you know that they also immunize farm aminals against deadly diseases? I did mention it my last DD, but by that time I was so burnt out I couldn't continue on expanding how that will be immensely beneficial.

&#x200B;

I was dreading writing a DD about the latest developments of avian flu, but luckily, news articles are doing it for me.

&#x200B;

A bird flu has been going on for longer than you think; believe it or not. Since my first ECL post actually. The CDC has already locked down the number of birds per square foot and all regulations that have been put in place are already here. What I am basically saying is that if you want to yolo on egg futures, it won't work out. Now... How does $ECL play into all this? well, as I said previously (read section 6 (it's quick) and come back), they immunize farm aminals.

But, just like ""Nalco"" is handling the water side, ""CID Lines"" is handling the livestock side.

I don't know. don't care. just want to make money. ECL still is the way. probably going to 260 easy.

565,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,Elevance Health,22,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

567,"All in on obesity, Calls on Calories",wallstreetbets,Eli Lilly and Company,54,58,08-04-2024 19:20:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bz6n69/all_in_on_obesity_calls_on_calories/,"Disclaimer: I‚Äôm a potato who is morbidly stupid and obese. Don‚Äôt listen to me. Do your own DD.

TL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it‚Äôs undervalued with huge forward looking potential.

Four main points:



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly
2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses
3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue
4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Novo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight & live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they‚Äôll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can‚Äôt make money? I‚Äôll tell you how degens



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly

Novo Nordisk:



* Market cap: 436 B
* Net Sales Growth: +31%
   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%
   * Net Profit Growth: +51%
* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion
* Net Profit Margin: 36%

Eli Lilly:



* Market cap: 745 B
* Net sales growth: +20%
   * Earnings per share: -16%
   * Net profit Change: -16%
* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion
* Net Income Margin: 15.3%

Comparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don‚Äôt short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly‚Äôs out of the water.

Hell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.

The numbers speak for themselves.



1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses

In their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first ‚Äúapproved weight management medicine \[that\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death‚Äù is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a ‚Äúpriority review‚Äù.

Why is this a big deal?

Because according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.

That means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.



1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue

Demand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.

The biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they‚Äôre heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.

‚ÄúIf you produce it, they will come‚Äù



1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Today, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.

But Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.

Now if you‚Äôre too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.

There are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.

The other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.

So yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.

568,Today's game - buy the dip,wallstreetbets,EQT,27,12,12-04-2024 14:04:12,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c29zsf/todays_game_buy_the_dip/,"**JPM, WF, and C Report - All Beating Numbers, Only C Up - Good Buying Opportunity for JPM**

The market continues to be a bit skittish, down about 3/4% at the time of writing.  I had positioned for this trade yesterday by NVDA puts that I closed out to open calls that I will cash Monday. Sometimes you can just print money.

The earnings reports show what I've been saying - good earnings will be rewarded and the market will continue to grind higher. Yes, it's a little lower right now, but we'll be higher coming out of this earnings season as companies keep reporting strong results.

The key points:

* JPM, WF, and C all beat earnings expectations
* Only Citigroup (C) stock is up on the reports
* I think JPMorgan (JPM) is a good buying opportunity here

Looking ahead, I expect the ""rate cuts"" narrative to return once the next inflation print comes around.

The bottom line is to keep buying the dips. This market is giving a great opportunity to make money, so take advantage of it.

PS - yet again some folks reaching out to ask where to put money to work.  So here we go:

* Cybersecurity: this is a growth segment that is very cash rich due to high margin business the large businesses operate in. ZS and PANW are good names to buy before their earnings (expect some volatility)
* Large caps will continue to perform better this quarter, but will give way to small caps at some point this year as the interest rate story comes.
* Utilities/ energy are no longer looking attractive, but look for natural gas exposure (EQT is a good name).
* Banks: higher interest rates will benefit larger banks.  Buy JPM!

Lay off of NVDA for a few weeks.  Get out of AMD and stay out."
569,EQT - room to run?,wallstreetbets,EQT,0,8,04-04-2024 12:36:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvm1ma/eqt_room_to_run/,"I had EQT on my radar after they announced plans to reacquire the pipeline company they previously spun off. The market initially didn't like the deal, sending EQT's stock tumbling - creating an undervalued opportunity that I pounced on around $34.

However, after taking a nice profit by exiting my position in the $36.80s, EQT has continued grinding higher, now stabilizing north of $37. A few factors seem to be pressuring the stock - excess natural gas supply, Biden's unfavorable energy policies, and an overall tough market backdrop for the sector.

That said, with EQT appearing to find its footing, I suspect the rebound could continue towards the $45 level. For now, I'm staying on the sidelines to watch the price action play out. But I may re-establish a position if we get another dip towards $36, although that may not materialize for a while.

The energy trade remains volatile, but EQT's beaten down levels presented an attractive risk/reward, especially as it hasn't run up compared to its other energy peers (of course given nat gas has continued to be depressed). "

Rivian **HAS** to be paying rent, there isn‚Äôt this much parking space anywhere within 100 miles of the plant. Normally manufacturers just slow production but Rivian was trying so hard to hit mass quantity before confirming demand that it‚Äôs biting them in the ass.

With this much extra supply and dwindling demand for EVs, it probably makes sense for them to do their plant maintenance now. But everything I see about this company keeps reinforcing that they‚Äôre approaching the end of their runway fast. A share dilution is probably gonna happen soonish.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023.

She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

579,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,FactSet,201,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

580,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,FactSet,130,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

‚Äî-

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

The one thing I do know is if things go sour in the market, which they will at some point since euphoria never lasts forever - money will obviously go back to bonds for safety.

Each craft will cost around 50 mil and the initial fleet will consist of 5 crafts, 4 operational and 1 backup. They plan to put this craft to work running between 300 - 400 flights per year and generating an annual revenue of around $1.3 billion with a gross profit of $800 - $900 mil.

New Delta spaceship factory in Phoenix close to completion, production on the Delta craft set to begin in the coming months.

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

The early Easter holiday likely brought some spending from April into March. Controlling for these seasonal impacts, spending fell 0.7% month-over-month (MoM).
* While spending was soft on the month, the solid labor market continues to sustain consumer momentum. March saw strong jobs growth, and this appears to be reflected in strengthening after-tax wages and salaries growth in our data ‚Äì with growth at the highest level since early 2023.
* Tax refunds may also provide additional support to households, with average refunds up by 5% this year through the end of March. While most consumers appear to be planning to save or pay down debt, there is a small rise in people saying they will go shopping.

However, it is also a very fragmented space. After a big pullback due to Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reporting disappointing results, the whole sector took a dump and then has traded in a narrow range, trending down slightly in the last month. This has created an interesting buying opportunity, if you pick the right names.

First a little history lesson on PANW's earnings call that turned the tide. In its FY23 report, PANW unveiled a ""new platformization strategy"" - essentially bundling products, which is a trend we've seen across various industries (Progressive to FedEx). However, the results so far have been underwhelming with PANW seeing a significant decceleration. Then more recently in its Q2 results, PANW cited ""demand fatigue"" to justify a significant deceleration in its own product sales. This in turn had a negative impact on its cybersecurity peers.

The reality check:

1. The ""demand fatigue"" narrative was not borne out, as peers like ZS, CRWD continued to grow at 30%+ clip, while PANW guides for just 2-4% growth.
2. The price action initially was correlated, but has now started to diverge as active investors shift dollars from PANW to other players they believe will win. Given PANW's brand recognition, I suspect we'll see more allocation from sidelines than a shift from PANW.

Key names to consider:

1. CRWD: Crowded trade, higher risk. Hold.
2. PANW: Thrown all the bad news, price action reversing. A ""must own"" cybersecurity stock, also bought by Nancy Pelosi. Buy.
3. ZS: Had a good but not great quarter. Historically, ZS beats sales by 5%, but the beat was only 3%. Stock has traded sideways, but on top of larger Fed deals, Zscaler is poised to recover towards $240 as it beats earnings. Hot buy.
4. FTNT: Appears cheap, but not in the same league. Sold off after a recent cyber event. Sell if you own it.

Overall, the cybersecurity space presents an interesting opportunity, but pick the right names. ZS is my top pick. PANW next.  Skip the rest."

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)).

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA‚Äôs tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they‚Äôre expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

595,Snowflake isn't worth $50 Billion Dollars,wallstreetbets,Fidelity National Information Services,345,251,02-05-2024 21:34:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cirikp/snowflake_isnt_worth_50_billion_dollars/,"THESIS:
The issue with snowflake is that they‚Äôre a distributed data warehouse, not a distributed compute framework. 

However, distributed compute frameworks are more useful for complex ‚Äúdata science‚Äù tasks because most data needs to be ‚Äòengineered‚Äô before interesting analysis/machine learning can occur.

This post explores the idea that Snowflake is intentionally misleading investors by obfuscating the concrete services that they offer:

- Snowflake DOES NOT offer a general purpose ‚Äòdistributed computing framework‚Äô or ‚Äòdistributed compute runtime‚Äô.
- Snowflake SHOULD NOT be compared to ‚Äòspark‚Äô in benchmarks
- Snowflake DOES NOT (physically) store your data 
   - subtext: storing data in cloud object store is trivial





THE EVIDENCE/ANALYSIS I PROVIDE IS BASED OFF OF:

- ~~- Carnegie Professor Andy Pavlo‚Äôs Snowflake lectures from his Advanced DB series~~


- My opinions about misrepresented features that have limited real world utility
- Misleading promotional information for investors
- My (limited) experience using the product
- Lack of substantive online discourse(Reddit, Youtube)

DISCLOSURE: 

- I‚Äôve held a long short position(<$8k) since ~December which I rolled over into a different long short position after the CEO resigned. Imo, the CEO resigning in February is worse in the long run for my position because it was a good business move. 
- FWIW, I don‚Äôt hold individual stocks; my entire portfolio is just VTI and this small amount of Snowflake puts. 
- I am a Software Engineer and I used Snowflake for a short period at work.

MY CLAIMS: 

- Snowflake's differentiated utility is confusing to the lay investor, industry, and their own customers
- Snowflake‚Äôs valuation should be closer to Vercel‚Äôs, in $5 - $10 billion range.

Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020.

Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up.

599,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Fidelity National Information Services,198,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

601,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,wallstreetbets,Fidelity National Information Services,0,125,12-04-2024 14:19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ad4f/gopro_is_ridiculously_cheap_fundamentally/,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives."

So, how's everyone else's ports looking like, hopefully better than mine.

603,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,Fidelity National Information Services,58,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Will the ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù Exit Impact Apple Stock.

Why Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple."

607,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Fifth Third Bank,215,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

* Inflation and Rate Cuts: The volatility is likely to persist over the next several weeks as the inflation picture becomes clearer (it appears to be coming down) and the timing of rate cuts by the Fed (potentially June or July) becomes more certain.
* Overall Outlook: Despite the recent choppiness, this remains a fundamentally strong market backed by a robust economy. My advice would be to take advantage of the volatility and Buy! There seem to be some solid opportunities emerging.

We are in the third innings of a bull market that's just started.  Buy!

  
PS - there's always some commentary on market having run up too fast, etc.  Just remember it took a big dump the prior year.  Those looking for a big correction also need to look at the history: we haven't seen strengthening economy and weakening markets.  There's a wall of worry to climb, which this market will climb."

There are several factors that contribute to the belief that Tesla is undervalued as a company. Firstly, Tesla is a pioneer in the electric vehicle industry, which is experiencing significant growth due to increasing environmental concerns and a shift towards sustainable transportation. With their innovative technology and strong market presence, Tesla is well-positioned to capitalize on this trend. 

Secondly, Tesla has established itself as a leading brand in the automotive industry. Their vehicles are known for their high performance, cutting-edge features, and sleek design, which have garnered a dedicated customer base. This brand recognition and customer loyalty contribute to the company's long-term growth potential.

Furthermore, Tesla's expansion beyond the automotive sector sets it apart from traditional car manufacturers. The company has made significant strides in renewable energy with its solar panels and energy storage solutions. This diversification not only provides additional revenue streams but also positions Tesla as a key player in the broader clean energy market.

Additionally, Tesla's continuous investment in research and development allows them to stay at the forefront of technological advancements in the industry. Their commitment to innovation, evidenced by their Autopilot feature and ongoing improvements in battery technology, further strengthens their competitive advantage.

Lastly, the global demand for electric vehicles is expected to rise in the coming years as governments worldwide implement stricter emission regulations and incentives for clean transportation. Tesla's established infrastructure, including Supercharger stations, gives them a competitive edge in meeting this growing demand. "

611,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,FirstEnergy,40,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"
612,Ramblings of a Remora: The size of the future AI market is truly hard to fathom and it's impact hard to imagine.,wallstreetbets,FirstEnergy,9,14,05-04-2024 18:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwpl5n/ramblings_of_a_remora_the_size_of_the_future_ai/,"It begins as a ""tool"", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

Interest rates are staying higher for longer - and that's because economy remains strong.  Next quarter will outdo the current quarter.  Buy buy buy!

Load up on the beaten down stocks - they are going to be making a comeback this quarter.

For those looking to diversify beyond the typical large-cap index funds/ tickers like NVDA, SPY, and QQQ, I suggest examining the fundamentals and exploring some of the market's subsectors that have been relatively underperforming in the first quarter.  Current environment will support gains in oil (expect it to hit 100 by the summer).

Consumer discretionary will benefit as people loosen their purses a bit, select energy plays that haven't yet spiked, utilities, banks, and cybersecurity should benefit.  A word on cybersecurity, China and Russia are super active in the election year and many names have been left behind. Look also for companies with exposure to the public sector (I won't name the names as they are hated by most!!! - one name I can speak of that combines both cyber and public sector exposure is $ZS).

Identify the pockets of the market that have been left behind as the select names have rallied. As those large-cap leaders consolidate and stabilize at current levels, which I expect to happen in the second quarter, these overlooked subsectors will present opportunities.

Find undervalued gems before the broader market rediscovers AI."

Basically the numbers were a lot worse than I expected, I lost another even more substantial portion of my life savings in a few hours on my calls so I stayed up late looking for Copium. I would like to be brutally honest and serious here. Trigger warning for the next part because first I need to get real.¬†¬†

The bad news is that net revenue was down 12% probably on lower margins as vehicle sales remain constant as it seems they are struggling to clear glut of inventory however declining market share in North America and Europe seems to have stabilized. Part of my Thesis was the fact that while EV sales have slumped a little their ICE business was an underestimated solid cash printing machine with high margins for the next few years however it seems they have been affected by malicious negative consumer sentiment. I read online that Stellantis vehicles are the worst shit, overpriced, outdated and very unreliable (FIAT is apparanty now an acronym that means ‚Äòfix it again Tony‚Äô) and insiders say they are failing to invest in expensive next gen motor technology, staff morale is appalling and quality control issues so maybe that is catching up with them however most of this was on reddit and reddit has an American bias although North America is still where they earn about 50% of their profit and is declining. Apart from that the few sales they had in China have all but collapsed down 50%, South America where they had strong growth reversed and the luxury division (Maeserati) performance also collapsed.¬† They also performed a lot worse than closest european competitor Volkswagen  did in Q1 which is trading on similar multiples

When I am down and unsure of myself I start to write a story so bullish that I start to believe in myself again. Despite the problems I still believe my $25 Jan 2026 calls are  going to print because BEV sales are up 8% and as the press release says they have 25 new models including 18 new BEV models ¬†planned for this year of which they have only released 4 so far. This is only the start of the ramp up towards their [Dare Forward 2030 Strategic Plan](https://www.stellantis.com/en/company/dare-forward-2030) in which they plan to reach 100% BEV Sales in Europe and 50% BEV sales in Europe by 2030. They are the only ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô auto manufacturer to earn positive margins on EVs so far and will use their dying legacy auto business to finance this huge ramp up and become a profitable EV company. They say 800 km of range, yes 800 for their new models and ultra fast charging.¬†Furthermore they have great eurpoor subdies in France and pressuring Italy to do the same or they will move production to France. If someone doesn't believe Stellantis will become a profitable EV manufacturer in the next decade they should not be an investor in the company.  "

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs).

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.

>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year.""¬†

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.

Matter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.

In the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

1. Ceo takes Ketamine
2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)
3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming
4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)
5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)
6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)
7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem
8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation
9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth
10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states
11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago
12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars
13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)
14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer
15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization
16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift
17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique
18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price
19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream
20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen
21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore
22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected
23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla
24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency

619,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,Ford Motor Company,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

It's time to go balls deep in $XPEV - the Tesla of China (without the lay-offs). Here's the DD from an industry observer who knows the market and the desperation of foreign OEMs:

 üêâ  **CHINA IS BOUNCING BACK** üìà [PMI readings](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/01/china-april-2024-caixin-manufacturing-pmi.html) released two weeks ago are looking bullish AF, and NEV sales [surged 80%](https://cnevpost.com/2024/04/03/china-mar-nev-retail-698000-preliminary-cpca/) MoM. Plus, GDP grew by a [healthy 5.3% in Q1](https://edition.cnn.com/2024/04/15/business/china-q1-gdp-growth-intl-hnk/index.html). The Chinese are gonna be all over XPEV like white on rice.

üöó **XPEV IS THE TECH KING** üëë These crafty fuckers [""borrowed""](https://www.business-standard.com/article/companies/elon-musk-says-chinese-rival-xpeng-stole-tesla-and-apple-codes-120112300398_1.html) Tesla's autopilot algorithms and gave them a facelift, 'cause that's how they roll in the land of the red dragon. Their L3 autopilot is already [available across China](https://ir.xiaopeng.com/news-releases/news-release-details/xpeng-expands-nationwide-coverage-xngp-china-market), and next year, it's going global. Elon, watch your six.

üåç **XPEV IS EXPANDING LIKE A MOFO** üöÄ They're spreading faster than herpes during the prom night. They've invaded the [UAE, Thailand, and Egypt](https://electrek.co/2024/02/22/xpeng-motors-global-expansion-announcing-dealer-partnerships-5-new-markets/), with their G6 SUV leading the charge. And if you thought ""[Like a G6](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w4s6H4ku6ZY)"" was just a catchy tune, think again - it's XPEV's battle cry for world domination. They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

ü§ù **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  üå≠  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech, they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy. VW can't sell their MEB Platform-based EVs in China without bleeding cash, so they're going all-in on [XPEV's engineering nectar](https://www.volkswagen-group.com/en/articles/ready-for-next-ev-push-volkswagen-enters-into-agreement-with-xpeng-for-fast-joint-development-of-two-smart-e-cars-18246). We're talking about a massive revenue stream and validation of their tech on a global scale, you autists.

üí∞ **BUDGET BRAND = MASSIVE TENDIES** üí∏ [XPEV is dropping a low-cost brand](https://cnevpost.com/event/xpeng-new-brand-debut/) that's gonna make their costs lower than your standards after a night of drinking. They're gonna be printing tendies faster than Jerome Powell can say ""transitory inflation.""

Now, here's the kicker - they've even got flying cars in the works. Yeah, you heard that right, the [Xpeng X2](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/chinas-xpengs-drone-car-aeroht-voyager-x2-completes-low-altitude-flight-2024-03-08/). But I'm not even gonna elaborate, 'cause you'd think I'm smoking the same stuff as Hunter Biden in Forbidden City.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post, just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. üòâ

Remortgage your mum's apartment for this, 'cause it's time to get fucking PAID.

TL;DR: XPEV 4/19 and 4/26 calls. Literally can't go tits up. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

Take Toyota they have apps in there infotainment that they no longer support with cars sold only a few years ago.

When you want to update it you have to go use a USB drive.   Look at Ford, GM and there screens and overall tech sucks it literally like it was from the 90's.

No one in tech wants to work for a Toyota or GM, Why would you?

The American car companies are saddled with debt and there stuff breaks so much even Ford announced the warranties are an issue.  They literally have 50 year history of making junk.

Yet everyone thinks The Big 3 in the US are going to come up with the latest designs and move to EV.   They always made junk what makes you think they will make something people want like Tesla."
622,"Cummins ide me, Daddy: A $9.7 Billion Dollar Gay Bear Tail Thesis (CMI)",wallstreetbets,Ford Motor Company,28,28,08-04-2024 01:40:02,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bylmq5/cummins_ide_me_daddy_a_97_billion_dollar_gay_bear/,"For those of you regards that are too pussy to YOLO 0DTE SPY puts, you'll love this because a SPY drawdown would cause this theory to execute as well since CMI currently trends closely with the SPY.

First, if you don't know Cummins, they make arguably the best Diesel engines on planet earth. If you're a Suits fan, think McKernon motors, but for Diesel trucks. Historically, they're an incredibly stable company and have been in the business for a longgg time out of Indiana. So why puts?

Well, the first thing that caught my eye, was a MASSIVE lawsuit they just¬†[settled with the EPA to the tune of $1.7 billion](https://apnews.com/article/cummins-doj-settlement-engine-emissions-claims-b80708c6ebe8eb7e7a3684db0837e209)¬†for¬†*allegedly*¬†(absolutely) using emission defeat devices and violating the Clean Air Act. And the promise to recall all one million RAM trucks to make them emission compliant. They've already paid the fine, but the recall costs are still coming in hot. This settlement has opened the flood gates, as they're now getting sued by¬†[shareholders and Dodge Ram truck owners](https://www.therepublic.com/2024/02/19/cummins-faces-shareholder-and-customer-lawsuits-after-2b-settlement/). 

This alone doesn't mean shit for me (although it does add to the Bear case), but there is some fuckery afoot that caused some red flags to rise.

During the midst of all this legal drama, Cummins has finalized a full separation from their sister company,¬†[Atmus Filtration](https://www.cummins.com/news/releases/2024/02/14/cummins-launches-exchange-offer-separation-atmus-filtration-technologies). This dissolution and subsequent stock exchange program for Cummins investors¬†[finalized on MARCH 13th, 2024](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240318925736/en/Cummins-Announces-Final-Results-of-Exchange-Offer-and-Finalizes-Separation-of-Atmus-Filtration-Technologies-Inc).

Why is that important? Well, I'm not entirely sure how much revenue/influence Atmus had on Cummins stock, but apparently this decision impacted hedge fund sentiments in a very big way. Here's the¬†[SI on CMI](https://fintel.io/ss/us/cmi)¬†from August through March:

[32,498,522 Shares is a $9,771,330,609 short investment at current price](https://preview.redd.it/vuxe99yds5tc1.png?width=528&format=png&auto=webp&s=04739ca4795079bab4e6aeca00851152e05b19e7)

Remember that the first article to finalize dissolution was February 14th, where we see a bump from 1,983,145 to 3,231,342 SI, just a casual 63% increase. But what's remarkable is that once the dissolution is finalized in March the SI jumps to 32,498,522, or 24% of the Float. This is a 1,529% increase from January 31st!!

This is fascinating because the company has actually outperformed the SPY, even since that date. I may be a smooth brain, but knowing that the price was \~$270 mid march, that means shorts are currently looking at a billion++ dollar loss if the price stays at $300+.

So why now? Earnings.

CMI earnings date is 4/30/24 and this is their first earnings since the new lawsuits, the Atmus dissolution finalization, and their guidance during Q4 literally stated they expect a drop in revenue between 2-5% just from market forces, not even considering these other factors. They've also had declining EPS for four straight quarters, yet their expected EPS is $5.11, a number they've only beat ONCE in the last decade. Definitely feels like analysts are setting them up to fail so the rug pull can be explained.

This just¬†***feels***¬†like insider trading/knowledge of either more Government hits; lawsuits; or Atmus Filtration dissolution implications that laymen don't understand. Whatever it is, I'm tailing the big money on this one. Wish me luck, regards!

TL;DR - Big money going gay bear mode Cumming(s) all over an engine company that just got dodge Rammed by the EPA, no filter.

She continued: ""Most analysts have Tesla classified as an auto company. It isn't. It isn't at all. It's a robot, energy storage, AI company, and its margins will show through.""

""The auto industry -- Ford and GM -- is backing away from EVs. That's a big mistake because the only way they'll become profitable is to scale [EVs.] So they're basically ceding the market to Tesla and they will have obsolete products as Tesla's cars drop into the $20,000 to $25,000 range within five years, compared with their average of $30,000 to $45,000.""

624,Higher Oil/Gas will push for greater EV adoption. ,wallstreetbets,Ford Motor Company,0,68,05-04-2024 14:19:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwj80w/higher_oilgas_will_push_for_greater_ev_adoption/,"High oil prices are creating a favorable environment for EV adoption by making EVs more attractive over ICE.

1. Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.
2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.
3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption. This would create a rotation out of ICE cars and into EV's. This comes at a bad time as GM and Ford are scaling back EV production.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html)

I think things in the middle east will escalate so will things with Russia/NATO. This will push oil prices to very high levels and will lead to a EV rush. Tesla's inventory should shrink as prices are super low.  All commodities are going higher right now. No one wants to pay $10 per gallon of gas or $100+ for a fill up each week."
625,Gogoro Q1 Recap,wallstreetbets,Ford Motor Company,16,11,05-04-2024 10:12:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bweenz/gogoro_q1_recap/,"**Q1 Scooter Sales in Taiwan**

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**International Recognition**

March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific‚Äôs #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.

Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

&#x200B;

* Lockheed won a $17 BILLION dollar Missile Defense contract 
* Initial funding upon award, with incremental payments based on development milestones.  (Aka they are getting money NOW for this project, RIGHT NOW)

Now you typical Red Candle Lickers would start buying shares in LMT but this is REGARDED short sighted behavior. Because that 17B isnt profit, it has to be used to R&D, test ,build and most importantly SOURCE MATERIALS for the project. So here comes the play!!!

&#x200B;

The real winner of these defense contracts is the suppliers of the actual advanced composite materials. They will actually see the real profit of these contracts. And the best one in the business HEXCEL. (HXL)

&#x200B;

* **Hexcel (HXL):**  A leading producer of advanced composite materials used in aerospace and defense applications.  
* a huge long time partner and supplier of Lockheed (LOCKED IN)
* Hexcel recently appointed a new CEO, Tom Gentile, the former CEO of Spirit Aero Systems and GE Aero (you think this guy doesn't have huge connections?)
* The ""street"" pretended to not like the news of the new CEO and sold off 20% in a single day. fueck em!! all this means is that HXL has a huge margin of safety built in. This aint a damn meme stock boys

&#x200B;

&#x200B;

You want more? the new CEO reaffirmed the already extremely positive guidance for 2024 provided on Feb 20th including their outlook from 2024-2026!! REAFFIRMED! Do you really think the CEO that oversaw some of the largest stock market gains in GE and Spirit Aero is really gonna shit the bed enough to warrant a 22% drop/ 1.5 billion dollar market cap? hell naw billy!!  


My play? I'm in long and heavy because plays like this dont give a shit about rate cuts or how many lattes your coworker Susan is buying. 

$40k margin'ed up to $80k worth of stock

CHEAP AS FUC $1.25  $65 5/17 calls (earnings is 4/22 so 4/19 plays are meh)

NEED MORE?  CHEAP AS FUC $1.90  $65 6/21 calls  or $70 for $0.85

CHEAP AS FUCK $ 2.15 $70 9/20 CALLS, This captures earnings along with a rate cut even though it doesnt matter, it still might juice the market if it happens.

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**."
631,SoFi YOLO Update (with losses),wallstreetbets,Gen Digital,67,21,29-04-2024 16:30:16,https://i.redd.it/neramm1u3gxc1.jpeg,"(Posted originally with percentage, rather than dollar losses and mods removed understandably, so here we go)

Ouch. See my original post for ‚Äòinvestment thesis.‚Äô
I‚Äôm still holding though, I didn‚Äôt full YOLO to 0dtes or weeklies on purpose here. Figured we might get some wild reaction like this. I think we see a rebound this week after earnings is digested and potentially getting more coverage.

Coming from my FinTech experience, this is what I really honed in on during the CNBC interview, when Sara asked about the tech platform:

Noto:
...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, we‚Äôre building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and we‚Äôre the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, we‚Äôre building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and we‚Äôre turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.

tl;dr yolo not looking so hot, but smooth brain still like stonk"
632,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,General Dynamics,128,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

633,Never bet against the Military-Industrial complex - $GD,wallstreetbets,General Dynamics,90,51,15-04-2024 06:09:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4f1xn/never_bet_against_the_militaryindustrial_complex/,"&#x200B;

General Dynamics looks like a fantastic investment right now, with a perfect storm of escalating conflict in the Middle East, munitions demand that has scaled up tremendously over the last year, and a record backlog.

* **General Dynamics' products, such** as the NATO-standard 155mm shells, primarily the M795, are in high demand due to the ongoing conflict in Ukraine. These 155mm shells can be highly explosive, precision-guided, armor-piercing, or high fragmentation, showcasing the company's versatility and ability to meet diverse military needs \[1\].
* **Exhausted Inventories and High Production Goals:** U.S. inventories of the M-777 Howitzer, which uses these shells, are depleted, with significant quantities sent to support Ukraine. The U.S. has set ambitious production targets to increase 155mm shell production from current levels to 100,000 rounds per month by the end of 2025[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[2\].
* **Record Financial Performance:** General Dynamics recently reported its highest quarterly and annual revenue and earnings. With a net earnings increase and a record backlog of $93.6 billion, GD's financial health is robust, signaling future solid performance[ ](https://www.gd-ots.com/wp-content/uploads/2021/02/155mm-NextGen-202007.pdf)\[3\].
* **Continued Investment and Development:** To meet current and future demands, investments in production capacity, like the expansion in Scranton and new lines in Texas and Canada, are underway. The latest developments in ammunition technology are also expected to start full-rate production within the next five years, keeping GD at the forefront of military technology.
* **Record Backlog:** GD's backlog reached nearly $94 billion at the end of the year, marking the highest year-end total in its history. This robust backlog indicates a strong pipeline of future revenues and underpins the company's financial health \[4\].
* **Global Defense Demand:** The potential conflict between Iran and Israel has heightened the global demand for military equipment. As tensions escalate, countries seek to bolster their defense capabilities, which benefits manufacturers like General Dynamics, known for its diversified defense products \[5\].

With its strategic position in the defense sector, General Dynamics is poised for success. Their increasing production capabilities and strong financials make GD calls a clear and confident choice for investors.

\*This is not financial advice.\*

TL;DR - Buy morally compromised calls that might just be 5 baggers.

634,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,47,33,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

635,Pezempic aka Celsius DD Party ,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,34,69,04-05-2024 14:45:33,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ck1ycs/pezempic_aka_celsius_dd_party/,"All right boys, here it is the DD to end all DDs.

If you pay attention, you might find yourself floating in a green field enjoying the results of your multibagger getting that divorce you've always wanted and in a position for the first time in your life to not have to ask your wife's boyfriend for an allowance.

The play this week is 100% Celsius. Ticker symbol celh.

Google it regards. 

Why do you want to put your entire portfolio into this on Monday? I'll tell you. 

Firstly, this stuff is literally liquid cocaine. I know every single one of you have done cocaine and you all loved it. 
Imagine cocaine in liquid form. This is it. Sales Bros. Everywhere are crushing these things so they can stay awake and hit 40% of their quota.  Managers are crushing these things so they can ask how many dials their teams are making and why they haven't hit their number 3 days into the month.

But here's the rub. It's not just the sales Bros that are getting forced back into the office due to regarded RTO policies anymore. I mean don't get me wrong. That's a big reason why you should be going full port on its own offices are stocking the s*** up like crazy and it's flying off the shelves. But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. 

Secondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. 

I'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.

Thirdly, they're going international. 
They announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. 

Finally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.

That's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. 

That alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.

Now here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. 

Tuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market.

Good luck regards. I'll see you all in Valhalla.

636,My Stellantis Calls Will Print ,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,4,10,01-05-2024 09:05:29,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chhiox/my_stellantis_calls_will_print/,"Stellantis has just had their Q1 earnings call. Basically the numbers were a lot worse than I expected, I lost another even more substantial portion of my life savings in a few hours on my calls so I stayed up late looking for Copium. I would like to be brutally honest and serious here. Trigger warning for the next part because first I need to get real.¬†¬†

The bad news is that net revenue was down 12% probably on lower margins as vehicle sales remain constant as it seems they are struggling to clear glut of inventory however declining market share in North America and Europe seems to have stabilized. Part of my Thesis was the fact that while EV sales have slumped a little their ICE business was an underestimated solid cash printing machine with high margins for the next few years however it seems they have been affected by malicious negative consumer sentiment. I read online that Stellantis vehicles are the worst shit, overpriced, outdated and very unreliable (FIAT is apparanty now an acronym that means ‚Äòfix it again Tony‚Äô) and insiders say they are failing to invest in expensive next gen motor technology, staff morale is appalling and quality control issues so maybe that is catching up with them however most of this was on reddit and reddit has an American bias although North America is still where they earn about 50% of their profit and is declining. Apart from that the few sales they had in China have all but collapsed down 50%, South America where they had strong growth reversed and the luxury division (Maeserati) performance also collapsed.¬† They also performed a lot worse than closest european competitor Volkswagen  did in Q1 which is trading on similar multiples

When I am down and unsure of myself I start to write a story so bullish that I start to believe in myself again. Despite the problems I still believe my $25 Jan 2026 calls are  going to print because BEV sales are up 8% and as the press release says they have 25 new models including 18 new BEV models ¬†planned for this year of which they have only released 4 so far. This is only the start of the ramp up towards their [Dare Forward 2030 Strategic Plan](https://www.stellantis.com/en/company/dare-forward-2030) in which they plan to reach 100% BEV Sales in Europe and 50% BEV sales in Europe by 2030. They are the only ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô auto manufacturer to earn positive margins on EVs so far and will use their dying legacy auto business to finance this huge ramp up and become a profitable EV company. They say 800 km of range, yes 800 for their new models and ultra fast charging.¬†Furthermore they have great eurpoor subdies in France and pressuring Italy to do the same or they will move production to France. If someone doesn't believe Stellantis will become a profitable EV manufacturer in the next decade they should not be an investor in the company.  "
637,Coinbase will Moon after Q1 Earnings. (chart included),wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,25,39,30-04-2024 23:58:52,https://i.redd.it/32tct52sgpxc1.jpeg,"My grandma and your grandma were both talking about crypto while playing bridge at the senior home. With the launch of ETF, bitcoin went mainstream.

Rest written by AI:

Based on the graph you provided showing Exchange Normalized Trade Volume and the context of recent events, here's a bullish thesis for Coinbase regarding their upcoming Q1 earnings report:

### Coinbase Bull Thesis for Q1 Earnings Report

#### 1. **Increased Trading Volume and Revenue**
   - The graph indicates significant spikes in trading volume from January to March 2024. These periods of high trading volume are critical because they directly correlate with increased transaction fees, which are a primary revenue source for Coinbase. Given the substantial peaks, especially in February and March, Coinbase's revenue from trading fees is likely to have seen considerable growth in Q1.

#### 2. **Introduction of ETFs and Management Role**
   - The introduction of cryptocurrency-related ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) during this quarter, with Coinbase reportedly managing most of them, presents a significant growth opportunity. ETFs attract both retail and institutional investors, broadening Coinbase's customer base. Management of these ETFs not only generates management fees but also boosts trading volumes on the platform, further increasing transaction-based revenues.

#### 3. **Market Sentiment and Adoption**
   - The heightened activity and spikes in the normalized trade volume suggest increased market adoption and interest in cryptocurrencies. As a leading platform, Coinbase benefits from higher overall market sentiment, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. This trend is likely to have contributed positively to their Q1 earnings through expanded user growth and associated service fees.

#### 4. **Diversification and Innovation**
   - Coinbase has been diversifying its product offerings, including staking, custody services, and institutional investment solutions. These services contribute to a more stable revenue stream, balancing the volatility of transaction fees. The introduction and management of ETFs are part of this strategic diversification, likely enhancing the company's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.

#### 5. **Regulatory and Strategic Positioning**
   - Amidst increasing discussions around cryptocurrency regulations, Coinbase's proactive approach to compliance and its established position as a regulated entity in various jurisdictions could be seen as a competitive advantage. This positioning reassures investors and users, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs trustworthiness and user base, further impacting its Q1 performance positively.

#### 6. **Broader Economic Indicators**
   - The overall increase in digital asset trading volumes across various exchanges, as seen in the provided chart, suggests a robust period for the crypto market. As one of the leading exchanges, Coinbase is likely to have capitalized on this trend, enhancing its market share and revenue during this period.

### Conclusion
Coinbase's Q1 earnings are positioned to reflect a strong quarter, driven by increased trading volumes, the successful introduction and management of new ETF products, strategic market positioning, and a broadening of its financial services. Investors may look forward to a positive earnings report, underscoring the company's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment."
638,David Zaslav: Worst Media Exec of the 21st Century?,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,40,27,30-04-2024 16:38:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgxcj2/david_zaslav_worst_media_exec_of_the_21st_century/,"Since taking over Warner Brothers Discovery in 2022, the company has lost over 60% of its market value, tanked its relationship with talent and is now worth less than half of what Discovery paid for Warners Brothers just a few years ago. Also, they are still facing a mountain of debt, albeit slightly less since they have basically stopped making movies and new TV shows since the strike. Should they ever start spending money again, they will probably struggle to find traction given their heavy cable TV footprint and struggle to gain traction in streaming.

Stock is down almost 10% today and even at $7.40 it feels like a value trap. If it gets down near $6 you are starting to see the company worth less than the sum of its parts and there might be value there. Otherwise avoid this one at all cost. "

This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D.

You might wonder how I ended up in this erm, position. 

*record scratch*

For the sake of amusement and educational value, I certainly hope some of you might learn from my mistakes instead of stepping on the same rake.

It all began a few weeks ago.

https://preview.redd.it/5dbpqb1u65xc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14416697d69805e00b82eb53b072617b20a466dd

I got greedy. And greedy people make mistakes.

When Trump's Truth Social became a public company with the shittiest fundamentals known to mankind, no business plan and staggering losses, it was a no-brainer to short it. I learned options just so I could!

And the money was good. My first short had an expiration date of Jan 2025 and the strike price was $25. But because of all the greeks and short interest I sold it at a profit when DJT traded over $30! Wild. It retained its value so well because of long expiration date (theta).

Then I did some other trades, most of them reasonably successful and briefly my account went above $200k. That gave me a sense of false confidence. Easy money! Why, I could just make a thousand dollars a day shorting this thing and calling that thing. I just need a bit more practice. Right?

What I realized is that some options turn a profit in seconds and others can take days and weeks. And 1% for a minute of your time is better returns than 15% after two weeks of incubation.

Then I noticed that of all the trades I made the one that persistently delivered was DJT. It just kept sliding down on a schedule. It had places to be, somewhere between $0 and $2, as it seemed at the time.

So I yolod over 40k on a bet I thought would take a day or two at most. And to make it more profitable I reduced the expiration date to only a couple of weeks, so I could get more contracts for the price.

And then DJT shot up, changing trajectory that has been very predictable up to that point.

Why? Because it trades on sentiment, not fundamentals. Because market conditions. Because boohoo some evil hedgefund managers buy up shares so they can sell shorts and the low trade volume makes it easy to manipulate the stock price? BULLSHIT. These are self-delusions and lies. I don't know why, and never will, because I'm a retail trader and not an institution. 

THE EASIEST LIE IS THE ONE YOU TELL YOURSELF.

I can do my own research, sure, but I don't have the time to make it a full time job. Because of this, I will not have all the information that professionals have at their disposal. I hardly know what questions to ask.

A couple days later, looking at DJT (it should bounce down any day now!) I bought another put, this time aiming for $29 (it was trading around $30). I think they call it 'revenge trading' or 'emotional trading'. Don't do that.

Don't double down on a bad bet. Our brains use a lot of cheat codes to make snap decisions in stressful situations. We get adrenaline, our hearts start racing, our palms start sweating and our brains shut down higher brain functions to improve reaction time, known as 'fight or flight' response. It's great for hunting tigers and wolves. It's a really bad idea to do this when math is involved. And our tech is evolving faster than our bodies.

If you think you might be getting upset and not thinking things through, it's time to stop for the day and come back to it in the morning.

What else? Don't bet more than 10% of your port on any one company or event. Diversify. 

If you keep betting an increasing amount of money, no matter how certain the odds are, eventually the revolver drum will find the one bullet that will take you out in the Russian roulette you build out of your option contract. You're building a mouse trap to catch yourself, so uh, pad the walls a little. Make it a bit comfy.

As for me, I think my best option (teehee) is to fold and liquidate those bets on Monday on the best terms I can find, so I stop chasing the sunk cost fallacy and invest in something that can be more predictable in turning a profit. But I'm open to suggestions! I can't say that it's not tempting to let my puts ride all the way to $0. Part of me keeps wondering if it sinks down to 28 this week for no reason at all. But I also recognize this as a stage of grief known as 'bargaining'. 

I also believe DJT is still a penny stock that will go to $2 in September when Trump cashes out his cut and the price goes down, but my contracts don't have that long. Until September, it will fluctuate wildly, 1-15% a day in either direction as foreign interests and local patriots press buttons to make the money machine go brrr for fun and profit.

Could I straddle it and make some money back? Sure, but there are safer ways to make money right now and I'm going to focus on things with higher probabilities of success. 

This was the most expensive lesson of my life and if you read this far, you got it for free. You're welcome.

So stop munching on those crayons and think about contingency plans instead of throwing all your money on the next ""sure thing"". Options give you higher profits but there is a cost. And that cost is, you can lose everything. When a share price goes down, shares usually don't drop 30% in a day. 

So if you don't want your epitaph to be ""expired worthless"", think a little harder and double check the dates before you piss your money and metaphors against the wind.

I am also too regarded to input  images. This is my first post ever. Please be gentle fellow regards. **THIS IS NOT A SHORT TERM PLAY. Only shares atm.** 

Do you remember the housing market crash in 2008? Me neither! Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have been under government conservatorship through the FHFA since September 2008. [This article](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2)  written in 2022 is part 2 of a well written future outlook for the two  mortgage lending giants that were on the front lines during the 2008  housing crash. As I understand it, in order for the two companies to  escape from the conservatorship, they must first raise enough capital to  IPO, which is a massive undertaking. However, things are slowly looking  up. In 2019 the Trump administration authorized the two companies to  start building capital again by accruing retained earnings. Their  combined equity is cresting 100 billion. [It is thought that for both companies to IPO, a combined 150 billion dollars in capital would be required](https://furmancenter.org/thestoop/entry/when-will-government-control-of-fannie-mae-and-freddie-mac-end-part-2),  which is thought to be massive for an IPO. I believe these two  companies are in for massive gains in the upcoming years as they  continue to rebuild their coffers and potentially exit conservatorship.

  

But don't take my  word for it. Do a one year chart comparison of  the two companies (I would have included that, but I am so god damn  regarded). You might notice that things started to pick up around August  of 2023. I did some digging to find out what was going on around that  time, and lo and behold, [a  federal jury ruled in favor $FMCC and $FNMA, stating that the sweeping  of all their profits into the US treasury due to an amended stock  purchase agreement in 2012 was unconstitutional.](https://www.bsfllp.com/news-events/bsf-prevails-at-trial-in-decade-long-battle-against-fhfa.html) 

&#x200B;

These two companies are in control of \~**7 trillion dollars worth of assets (**[$FNMA](https://companiesmarketcap.com/fannie-mae/total-assets/#google_vignette) [$FMCC](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/BOGZ1FL404090423A)) combined. I have no idea what that means, but those are pretty big  numbers right? Too big to fail, in fact? One might think....   

With the housing market going crazy, [and a potential Trump win which would be highly favorable for FNMA and FMCC](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-18/a-trump-reelection-seen-as-bullish-for-fannie-freddie-shares),  these are two stocks that I think we should all have our eyes on, as  they seem fairly undervalued at the moment. People have forgotten about  them, and they shouldn't.   

[Here is an excellent interview transcript from the CEO of Fannie Mae, Priscilla Almodovar](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/why-ceo-fannie-mae-believes-100000781.html).  She is a relatively new CEO (2022 instated) as is the CEO of Freddie  Mac for that matter. She speaks very optimistically about the road ahead  for FNMA, and discusses the lessons learned over the past 15 years. [There](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-01-19/fannie-mae-ceo-discusses-government-conservatorship-of-gse) [are](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230137-anticipation-grows-for-end-of-gse-conservatorship?v=preview) [so many god damn](https://www.crefc.org/cre/content/News/Items/advocacy-items/Fannie_Mae_Envisions_Independence_from_Government_Control.aspx) [paywalled  articles from this year or last year in which the CEO and important  people are talking about the end of conservatorship](https://www.insidemortgagefinance.com/articles/230116-the-gses-have-been-profitable-since-2012-maybe-its-time-to-end-the-conservatorships?v=preview). So annoying.   

Options are not available for these two companies (maybe that has  something to do with the conservatorship, I have no idea), but the  shares I believe are extremely undervalued for what they could become  down the road. Please don't take this as advice.   

I have $2000 invested in both $FNMA and $FMCC for a total of $4000  because that's what I can afford right now. I would share a picture, but  the insert image button is not working.  "

(Reuters) - Jabil Inc has placed Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Wilson on a paid leave since April 15 pending completion of an investigation related to corporate policies, the electronic components maker said on Thursday.

The company appointed its current CFO Michael Dastoor as the interim CEO, effective April 19, according to its regulatory filing.

Jabil pointed to the filing in response to a request seeking more details on why Wilson was placed on leave.

Wilson was named CEO in November 2022, succeeding Mark Mondello, and assumed the role on May 1, 2023.

The company had last year announced that it would reduce headcount as part of its restructuring plan, estimating to recognize about $300 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs through fiscal year 2024.

644,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,204,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

Since then Google has released a couple of updates and it's absolutely annihilated most of my niche content.  

This has been bad for me, but great for large content producers like Reddit, Medium, Quora, etc who have all seen their organic traffic absolutely skyrocket in the past 6 months.  Google's Helpful Content Update (HCU) has pushed out a lot of frankly pretty bad websites like mine in favor of content that is verified by other users or from a larger site.  To give you a bit of an idea of the scale of this, here is a graph showing the assumed traffic to [Reddit.com](https://Reddit.com) from SEMrush.  This isn't exact and Reddit would have better numbers, but it showcases the absolutely stratospheric amount of traffic that Reddit is getting over the past 6 months.

Now here is Reddit's traffic from their own S-1 form over the past couple of years.  Note that the number of app users in Red increases slowly, but the number of non-logged in users increases and decreases in correlation with the SemRUSH graph.  That last little dip before it rockets to the moon is June 2023 which correlates with the logged out drop in Q2 2023 (29.2 million to 28.3 million).

You can see that by **FAR** the largest increase is in Q4 2023 which is only halfway up that SEMrush crayon line.  Reddit should easily see 40 million non-logged in daily users in Q1 if the trend continues.  These users all have a chance to convert into degenerates like you and me, but it doesn't really matter because that Daily Average Unique User is going to look sexy AF to investors when RDDT drops it's next earnings.

# But really it doesn't matter how many people log in or view the website because Reddit has never made money and can't monetize it's users.

Well, you're wrong about that too.  RDDT is on a path to monetize it's user base and has made a bunch of strides in the right direction in terms of advertising.  Anecdotally the quality of ads I've been receiving has been a lot better in the past year. 

# BUT THAT DOESN'T MATTER

Advertising is a marketplace and just like the stock market it goes up and down over the course of a year.  Reddit's advertising is much more tied to the intrinsic cost of advertising than it is anything they are doing internally.  They even mention it in their S-1 "" We experience seasonality in our business and financial results. Overall advertising spend tends to be highest in the fourth quarter of each year due in large part to end-of-year advertiser spending and lowest in the first quarter of each year. In addition, we believe our strong growth in prior periods has made it difficult to evaluate the impact of seasonality on our business, and we expect seasonality to become more pronounced in the future as our business matures. ""

To draw this out in a format you're used to you can check out this chart from Ezoic. I really dislike the company, but I do love their Ad Revenue Index which showcases your expected earnings showing display ads on a website.  This chart is a bit funky to read, but essentially it takes the highest mark on the day where you would expect to earn the most and then relates every other day to that.  

So as someone with a niche site, the best day for expected revenue was in November of 2021.  This was towards the end of Covid when the market was gearing back up, money was free, and Christmas was just around the corner.  That's why Q4 (November especially) is always the best for advertising companies (Christmas), and then it absolutely shits the bed in the New Year.  This happens EVERY year, except for this one.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/q4o0d1tzl4vc1.jpg?width=1138&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=95981bd9688da43c2b063010dad77086e8ec0ac5

You can play around with it here.

[https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche](https://nicheindex.ezoic.com/report#niche)

This year, there was the expected Christmas boom and then New Year hangover, but ad revenue is actually at the same or higher level than it was in November of last year.  This is unheard of and absolutely not the norm, but it relates to Christmas being a bit poor for advertising revenue this year while Q1 has actually been a bit strong for advertisers.

Now how does this relate to RDDT?

Well let's take a look, RDDT's revenue has been rising every year but it's Revenue is directly tied to the expected ad revenue.  If we pull their Quarterly Results of Operations data from their S-1 and take a look at 2021.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/5xnmh7crm4vc1.jpg?width=1255&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b97e1f962c1e39c8ba3f9b71354cf31c9e1e869e

In 2021 RDDT's revenue was 79 million for Q1, 108 million for Q2, 121 million for Q3, and 177 million for Q4.  This directly correlates with the ad revenue index where we would expect ad revenue to be roughly double (\~40th percentile to the \~80th percentile).  Then immediately into Q1 of the following year revenue drops from 177 million to 146 million which matches what we  see when comparing the chart.

Now what's interesting about this is that in 2024 we don't see that expected ad revenue drop in our ad revenue chart, in fact Q1 of 2024 might actually have a higher expected ad revenue than Q4 of 2023 especially in February and March.

So what happens when the Daily Average Unique users jumps up because Google has skyrocketed the organic users AND advertising revenue is higher AND you've improved your advertising platform?

Rocket meet moon.  RDDT is going to post a similar or larger revenue number to Q4 of last year showcasing 50+% revenue growth year over year and it's second profitable quarter in a row. Last Q1 they posted a revenue of 163 million, this Q1 I expect it to be right around the 250 mark and with revenue growing at three times the pace of costs this earnings report will knock your socks off.

646,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,126,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

649,ALCC/OKLO DD,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,44,58,13-04-2024 17:42:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c37inc/alccoklo_dd/,"I started looking into ALCC and Oklo this week after noticing the huge pump and dump this past week, and just thought I'd share some DD with you all.

Assuming that the merger closes without any ALCC public stockholders exercising the \~$10/share redemption right, the equity structure will probably look like this (from the amended S-4):

https://preview.redd.it/phe5mi8p4auc1.png?width=1256&format=png&auto=webp&s=5042d7131d540a850446c8b608dbc5c2d4b997f3

And post-merger, the combined financials will probably be similar to this:

https://preview.redd.it/amru6bau4auc1.png?width=1186&format=png&auto=webp&s=3993c76bfdabdfd3b7cbbb35a6661bc305b0cc14

Right now, pre-merger ALCC public stockholders' main asset is a \~$300M trust for potential redemptions ($10.41/share redemption price as of 12/31/2023).  Based on the equity structure above, after the merger and some dilutive options, ALCC public stockholders will only have a 17.6% share of the total $311 million in assets.  So what do ALCC stockholders get in return?  A piece of Oklo's future business... so what does that look like?

I don't know, and I'm not a finance person or someone in the energy industry, but i pretended to be and made a spreadsheet.  Also, I know stocks don't trade on fundamentals, but thought it might be helpful to think about it this way.



https://preview.redd.it/2a57btp48auc1.png?width=1087&format=png&auto=webp&s=aa8a9c4b0a5bcbf1d4ab7d65ea556c7c4c460e50

NRC regulatory approval is the huge threshold question.  If Oklo gets approval, and their product is for real, this company could be huge.  If NRC says nope, then the investment probably goes to zero.

In the ""bet analysis"" part below, I calculated an Expected Value based on 25% odds of regulatory approval using a discounted cash flow method.  You'll see that this model assumes that Oklo becomes as big as CEG in about 20 years.

Lots of IFs for this stock, but I ended up buying 1,000 shares at $12.85 on Friday because I think that Biden or Trump will continue pushing nuclear energy, and eventually, Oklo will get its NRC approval.  Planning on buying another 1,000 if it gets close to $11 before the merger.  And then I'll just keep my fingers crossed that Oklo is for realo.

**EDIT/UPDATE:**

- ALCC's financial advisor (Ocean Tomo) did a discounted cash flow analysis of the merger.  Interesting read, and it goes into their financial model analysis of the deal (search for ""Aurora 15we Illustrative Unit Economics"" and start reading from there):  

[https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849056/000110465924042658/alcc-20231231xs4a.htm)

- ALCC/sponsor shares are subject to various lockup periods subject to the stock price trading above $12/14/16 for 20 out of 60 consecutive trading days.  Oklo insider-owned shares are subject to lockup for 180 days past closing of the merger.

- SEC's new SPAC rules become effective July 1, 2024, so I'm thinking that the merger will happen in June so that ALCC doesn't become subject to the new disclosure requirements.

650,VST the Texas Energy Company just keeps defying gravity,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,9,10,09-04-2024 17:49:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzye8m/vst_the_texas_energy_company_just_keeps_defying/,"**Vistra Corp (VST)**

I think it took a real rise because of the [WSJ article](https://archive.ph/A5WHE) back at the end of March about VST being an AI stock and this thing looks more like NVDA every day. I call it my poor man's NVDA. Maybe my fellow smooth brains might see it too? This Texas based integrated retail electricity and power generation company is just on a tear this year. It has a focus on low and no carbon emission generation. They are pushing the boundaries towards a sustainable future; not just doubling down on fossil fuels while green washing with a dabbling in renewables. Even though this has increased from $38 to $70 as of this writing, I still think it's a sleeper hit in your investment portfolio, especially with the AI boom printing money. AI data centers need energy like they need NVDA chips. All part of the shovels to gold miners metaphor. 

**Fundamentals Highlights:**

* **Net Income Turnaround:** From a net loss of $1.21 billion in the previous year to a net income of $1.49 billion in 2023‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

Investor Relations](https://investor.vistracorp.com/2024-02-28-Vistra-Reports-Full-Year-2023-Results,-Announces-Expected-Closing-of-Energy-Harbor-Transaction-On-March-1,-2024))‚Äã.
* **Liquidity:** As of December 31, 2023, Vistra boasted about $5.8 billion in total available liquidity‚Äã ([Vistra Corp.

**Strategic Moves:**

* **Energy Harbor Acquisition:** Set to close on March 1, 2024, adding over 4,000 MW of nuclear generation and approximately 1 million retail customers‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

* **AI and Electricity Demand:** With the AI boom driving electricity demand, Vistra's strategic positioning and assets in nuclear, solar, and battery storage put it at a significant advantage‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

**AI Boom and Energy Sector Synergy:** The artificial intelligence revolution is set to spike electricity demand, with Vistra well-positioned to benefit. Investments in data centers, nearshoring of manufacturing, and electrification of transportation are projected to push electricity demand growth, with a CAGR of 13-15% through 2030 for data center electricity demand alone‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã‚Äã ([Vistra Corp.

**Market Potential:**

* **Stock Performance:** Vistra's stock has already seen an impressive 85% increase year to date, attributed in part to the AI-driven demand for electricity‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.
* **Power Demand Tailwinds:** Companies that are net long power, like Vistra, stand to gain as power demand escalates‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

**Risks and Considerations:** Undeniable growth doesn't mean undeniable rise in stock price. This is not financial advice and I have a bias to make this more popular. 

**Technical Analysis:** For what it's worth, the basic technicals are showing a slight pause and reversal to the 50 day SMA but still quite a bit above it. It's currently right in the middle of a Keltner channel but not below it enough to use the scalping tactic. So for any day trading or swing trading approach, I'd say just watch it for a better opening. Since this acts more like NVDA, then maybe waiting to jump in is just going to make it more expensive for you. 

**Conclusion:** Vistra Corp (VST) presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those looking to leverage the burgeoning demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. With solid financials, strategic growth initiatives, and a strong foothold in clean energy, Vistra is not just navigating the transition to a zero-carbon future; it's leading the charge. As the energy sector becomes increasingly critical in the AI era, Vistra's unique position could make it a standout choice for investors seeking growth and sustainability.

Vistra offers a blend of innovation, sustainability, and financial savvy that could pay dividends in the AI-driven future.

*My bias: I hold stock and have long call positions. I am long on 165 contracts @ $1 for 4/19 exp $75 calls which has a realistic possibility of the underlying going to $80 by expiration and being worth $66K profit. So, yeah I'd love nothing more than to see this rise. Today took a negative swing that might be a good opening as I opened 75% of my current position this morning as it took a major dump.* "
651,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,286,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

https://preview.redd.it/bev413gfdctc1.png?width=1634&format=png&auto=webp&s=dc3ee9af7c38cd1e18e5dd0427e3e492d4584aee

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**GamePlan**

**I like Aug/Nov 2024 ($20c-$25c) and Jan 2026 LEAPs ($20c to $25c).  I think 2025 is a bit crowded and I like the extra delta that the MMs would need to hedge on the 2026s.  Shorter dated calls are also an option as that could positively affect the price.**

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Too tired to write more...

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

652,"Tesla stock owners, when will you sell?",wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,56,236,05-04-2024 22:16:08,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwuvcy/tesla_stock_owners_when_will_you_sell/,"Genuine question to the people that hold Tesla stock for the long term or are currently buying the dip. What will be the final straw that causes you to sell the stock? The fundamentals of the company are degrading, yet the stock price isn't really going down that much. This means that people aren't really selling. The stock trades at a forward PE of about 60, probably higher if current estimates are too high, which they likely are. The growth of the company is stalling and the company is desperately trying to drop prices and do all sorts of other things to sell cars. Elon is a loose canon and while in the past that was a good thing, it now seems like more of a liability than at anything. The stock trades at a rich valuation because people expect a bright future ahead, but what will cause you to change your mind about Tesla's future and sell the stock? Elon has promised quite a lot and you probably believe him, but he has a bad record of overpromising, so what, if anything, will cause you stop believing in what he says? 

I hold no positions in Tesla but have a bearish view because I think their valuation is too high."

If you read someone's ""DD"" and part of that ""DD"" is something related to dividend capture, how there's an upcoming dividend, etc., you immediately know this person is a complete fucking regard and has no idea what he's talking about, and you should probably evaluate the ""DD"" with that lens.

I've recently read some [moronic DD](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bslbdu/ges_covering_by_special_dividend_416/) on GES's upcoming special dividend and the amount of blind ignorance on even the most basic of corporate finance concepts demonstrated in the comments is just astonishing (and somehow, a week after the fact, I'm still getting DMs asking me the most basic of stock market 101 questions).

1. Stock prices automatically adjust downward for both regular and special dividends on the dividend ex-date.

2. Option strike prices will get adjusted for special dividends.

3. The company pays out the dividend to ALL holders when a dividend is issued. That means if you are short a stock at $25, if the company pays out a $5 dividend, you, as the short-seller pay the $5 to the person you borrowed the share from (NOT to the company, as the idiot OP in that post seems to think). The company earns NO profit from issuing a special dividend, and it is always a cash outflow for the company. The short pays $5 for the borrowed stock dividend, the stock price gets adjusted from $25 to $20, and you're net even. YOU TOOK MONEY OUT OF ONE POCKET AND PUT IT INTO THE OTHER.

Other caveats that you regards don't seem to understand:

1. Dividends are double-taxed, meaning the company paid taxes on that income, and then you are paying taxes on the dividend.

2. By issuing a dividend, the company is essentially saying ""this fucking clueless regard on WSB knows what to do with the cash better than we do. We will trust them to manage the cash for us.""

Do you really want to invest in a company who thinks the average fucking room-temperature IQ regard on this sub has better cash-deployment skills than the company's management? If they didn't pay out the dividend, it goes to retained earnings, which can be used to fund growth, make acquisitions, improve operations, etc. Instead, they are trusting fucking /u/suckonyourmomstits to make better use of the cash than they could themselves.

This isn't an anti-dividend post; dividend-paying companies **can** have their uses in specific portfolio construction cases, however, it seems that the vast majority of regards on this sub completely misunderstand how dividends actually work."
654,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,Genuine Parts Company,8714,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

The Hershey Company

Exchange - Listed on both NYSE and NASDAQ

Ticker Symbol - HSY

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth."

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

I‚Äôm not saying to make a play because I don‚Äôt know how long this will take to play out but this company literally has no AI tech, weird offerings, dilutions, Goldmans running the market, a history of fraud, being delisted and one of the largest SEC fines.  So many red flags 

I‚Äôm more on the tech side but there‚Äôs so many alarms about this stock and the offering by Goldmans. Plus think of SMCI selling metal enclosures to house GPUs and CPUs.  We had many SMCI boxes that are 5+ years old.  Yes we‚Äôd upgrade the GPU/CPU every few years but the metal enclosure servers that were SMCI we rarely ever upgrade beyond 5+ years.  

PSA Don‚Äôt be their exit liquidity.  Lots of red flags, maybe you take a chance when it was $90 but at $1000 up 1000%  in a year and with all these red flags it‚Äôs a terrible investment."

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA‚Äôs tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they‚Äôre expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

Doing my dd, it seems to me that the price of cocoa will significantly impact Hershey's earnings, and if it doesn't, the guidance call will probably be ass.

For reference Mondelez MDLZ, also a [player](https://www.mondelezinternational.com/our-brands/) in the confectionaries, is trending down, they did beat expectations, but they had higher that expected expenses, and it doesn't seem cocoa prices will resolve quickly. Mondelez has tried to get ahead of it with a 2 years pricing for cocoa locked in, and the stock still getting destroyed, kinda.

Hersheys is in a more difficult situation. Unions have them by the balls, a not insignificant factor in their overall expenses. Most of their [brands](https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/home/brands.html) are chocolate ~~based~~ infused, basically their exposure to chocolate is a lot bigger than Mondelez. Consumer pull back on spending, and to make it worse, the US isn't exactly known for its consumption of chocolate Per Capita, I don't think we are in the top 5. Meaning, it s far easier for an average person to forego chocolate, especially if the prices for it to go up.

To summarize, high cocoa prices, wary consumer, high expense for Hersheys might lead to some downbeat guidance, maybe earnings mis. By how much I don't know, its smooth brain maths in here.

SInce this is not a DD, go do the research.

I am buying a put. A single put. But I would like to hear what you guys think.

The Hershey Company

Exchange - Listed on both NYSE and NASDAQ

Ticker Symbol - HSY

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth."

Over next few weeks, there will be a once in a 200 year cycle for cicadas, meaning there will be an insane influx of them all around the East/Midwest/south portion of the US. Its estimated that trillions of these cicadas will come crawling out of the ground in droves. The last time this took place was in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson was president.

668,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,wallstreetbets,Home Depot (The),28,22,10-04-2024 16:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pinl/pools_closed_why_lesl_is_circling_the_drain/,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

669,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,Humana,47,33,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

670,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,Humana,20,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

Good day fellow degenerates!

Some of you asked me to post an updated photo of my INTC position, but before, a few words. Since my DD, Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed, selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise, surprise, tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again, -8%, lol. Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3% the next day. 

Now, does all of this make sense? In some sense of course, the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years, which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor, Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary, I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor, Ryzen 9. No surprise, Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS, with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using, amongst others, the 20A process, meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process, resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT, GOOG, META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack, getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell, but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs, while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So, you may call me a degenerate idiot, I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However, no time pressure with shares, which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued, literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

2) with the etfs, who do they think is onboarding these etfs new billions and charging them fees? Even if it‚Äôs transferred money from grayscale, new ETFs gotta onboard fiat. Coinbase is proprietor for 8 of 11 BTC ETFs
3) retail use gotta be up, hell im using them sometimes again in spite of high fees
4) does anyone on wallstreet even know about coin‚Äôs defi network Base? Its activity with new memes amongst the defi community is huge, and its fees are high, true to Coinbase

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

The whole damn market is going down the crapper, but INTC is holding strong. These guys are built different, built to weather the storm. While these paperhanded chumps are crying over their meme stocks, INTC is gonna be quietly laughing all the way to the bank.

Look, I ain't no financial advisor, this is just my opinion. But if you degenerates want to make some serious tendies, then hop on the INTC train before it leaves the station. This is your chance to get in on the ground floor of a tech giant, at a discount! Don't be a fool and miss out, this is gonna be YUGE. üöÄüöÄüöÄ

If Intel's aggressive manufacturing revamp pays off, the company could snag back its process technology crown. The 18A node specifically has the potential to outperform anything TSMC currently offers. This would not only revitalize Intel's own chip production but could open the door to becoming a foundry for competitors.

Intel's Gaudi AI accelerators are already gaining traction. The upcoming Gaudi 3 promises significant performance leaps and could seriously challenge Nvidia's market dominance. Price-performance advantages and easy integration with popular AI frameworks could make Gaudi 3 a darling with enterprises scaling up AI deployments.

Intel is keenly focused on streamlining the notoriously complex world of AI software development. New software suites tailored for their AI hardware could create a compelling ecosystem for developers, attracting businesses and researchers alike. Increased ease-of-use is a major catalyst for broader adoption."

This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2

I can't think of a person leaving a company and just decimating the competition on the way out while blessing his former employer with the highest praise.

He's saying there is no chance in hell for others to catch up and not anytime soon.

I don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD, Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.

Here is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.

GPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief, Demis Hassabis, and I quote, "" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora."" And that's ALL GPU's folks.

If one major player or sovereign nation state gives up on the pursuit of AGI they will be behind in a severely detrimental manner.

696,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,Intel,650,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."

Good day fellow degenerates!

Some of you asked me to post an updated photo of my INTC position, but before, a few words. Since my DD, Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed, selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise, surprise, tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again, -8%, lol. Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3% the next day. 

Now, does all of this make sense? In some sense of course, the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years, which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor, Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary, I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor, Ryzen 9. No surprise, Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS, with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using, amongst others, the 20A process, meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process, resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT, GOOG, META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack, getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell, but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs, while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So, you may call me a degenerate idiot, I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However, no time pressure with shares, which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued, literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

698,Meta Platforms announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support AI generative artificial intelligence products and services,wallstreetbets,Intel,2,16,10-04-2024 16:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pyy6/meta_platforms_announced_its_latest_custommade/,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support generative artificial intelligence products and services on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

&#x200B;

The announcement made by South Korean President Yoon Suk Yeol also consists of a separate 1.4T won fund to support AI semiconductor companies, the report added.

&#x200B;

By setting aside investments and a fund, South Korea intends to expand research and development in AI chips such as artificial neural processing units, or NPUs, and next-generation high-bandwidth memory, or HBM, chips, the government said, as per the report.

&#x200B;

The country will also promote the development of next-generation artificial general intelligence, or AGI, and safety technologies which go beyond existing models.

&#x200B;

Yoon intends South Korea to become one of the top three countries in AI technology including chips, and take a 10% or more share of the worldwide system semiconductor market by 2030, the report added.

&#x200B;

Semiconductors are vital to the Asian nation's export-driven economy. In March, chip exports surged to their highest in 21 months at $11.7B, or nearly a fifth of total exports shipped by the country, according to the report.

&#x200B;

The U.S. is providing funding through its CHIPS Act, which aims to increase U.S. semiconductor manufacturing and research, especially in advanced semiconductors.

&#x200B;

Several companies are expected to get funds under the act, with Intel (NASDAQ:INTC) already having inked a deal for about $20B in grants and potential loans, and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing (NYSE:TSM) signing an agreement for up to $6.6B in grants and as much as $5B in loans. Samsung Electronics (OTCPK:SSNLF) is expected to be awarded more than $6B.

&#x200B;

Japan is also providing subsidies to companies to boost domestic chip manufacturing.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

I believe AMD will underperform the market which has room to run, but there are better players. 

AMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation ""something"" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

PS - based on comments a lot of folks lost money in AMD today and I am sorry about that.  Take my advice and don't lose the rest as it declines further from here. It has another 15-20% to go."

But now more importantly we're seeing the stuff pop up in gyms. And I'm talking all sorts of different gyms from planet fitnesses to your local CrossFit gyms. Why? Cuz it's basically a pre-workout too. You crack one of these bad boys before you hit the gym. You're guaranteed to have 100% gainz. Just like you're guaranteed to have 100% gainz on your profits this week. 

Secondly, their last earnings report was tremendous and there's no reason to believe that anything has changed. In fact, Pepsi just talked about them a bit in their earnings report and had nothing but positive things to say about the direction the company is going and their continued support. But it's not just the words. It's the actions. Pepsi is aggressively helping Celsius with their distribution Network, getting them into new markets as we speak and putting them up everywhere. Food stores, gyms offices you can't turn a corner without seeing this stuffb and that's partially due to Pepsi's commitment and full support with their distribution Network. 

I'm addition, they've actually come out with some pretty good new flavors. Their non-carbonated. Drinks are exceptional too.

Thirdly, they're going international. 
They announced it at their last earnings call and now they're executing putting in stuff all over the world so that more and more people can get addicted. 

Finally we shouldn't even be calling this stuff Celsius. We should be calling it PEPZEMPIC.

That's right folks. Not only is this stuff cocaine it's also healthy and helps you lose weight. It is a weight loss a drug that requires no prescription. 

That alone that last one right there alone means this thing is going to the Moon because all the fatties on the planet want to lose weight but they don't want to put in the effort to do it. Pop a couple Celsius. You're burning more calories than you do on a treadmill while shoving that cupcake and caramel macchiato down your gullet. Sure you might have a heart attack but who cares in the pursuit of good looks on only fans. There is no risk great enough for that.

Now here's the best part. We are not far off pre-last earnings Call pricing on stock. Sure, if you bought last week you'd be in better shape, but we're still not nearly where this thing spiked after a great earnings call in q1. Now's the Time and here's the play Monday. You pick your entry point. You buy the f*** out of this. 

Tuesday after this thing rips 15 to 20%. You sell before that guy from the FED who hates America comes out and says some hawkish stuff that tanks the market.

708,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,International Flavors & Fragrances,200,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not. And they will get it approved because Big Tobacco basically owns the FDA - [**100% of FDA‚Äôs tobacco department funding comes from big tobacco**](https://www.theamericanconsumer.org/2023/03/fda-should-reexamine-incentives-to-collect-tobacco-user-fees-fairly/). The feds are not on r/antiwork theyre big tobacco boot lickers looking for more funding, and they‚Äôll get it if they approve.

## Altria‚Äôs On! Nicotine Pouches - ZYNs Biggest Competitor

In case you didn‚Äôt know, all the main nicotine pouches that are popping up everywhere are owned by Big Tobacco. Altria is in on it with their On! Nicotine pouches. Altria had shipment issues in 2023 but they‚Äôre expected to double revenues from On! Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

## Bonus Altria is planning on selling its shares of AB InBev

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

I'm in the process of developing a trading strategy that involves buying 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts or 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts depending on market momentum. If I enter the trade before 2:00 PM, I purchase 0DTE SPY Calls/Puts. If I enter the trade after 2:00 PM, I purchase 1DTE SPY Calls/Puts. The strike price is always as close possible to the money.

¬†I generally know the optimal entry points for my trades, but I often struggle with determining the best exit points.

What‚Äôs your advice on when to exit a trade:

a) Should I exit when the momentum begins to slow down? For instance, if I'm holding a call option, I would sell when the first red candle (on a 15-minute chart) closes below the opening of the last green candle.

b) Should I exit when there‚Äôs a big move in the opposite direction? Based on historical data, this still results in a profit, though I sometimes lose 100% of the money I put in some trades as sometimes there‚Äôs never a big move in the opposite direction.

c) Should I set a fixed take profit or stop loss percentage?

d) Should I rely on ""intuition""?

e) Or should I use another metric?

Any guidance from experienced traders would be greatly appreciated!"

The Phallic Formation Indicator (PFI) is a groundbreaking technical  analysis tool that has revolutionized the way institutions interpret  market sentiment and price movements. By transforming traditional  candlestick patterns into distinctive phallic shapes, the PFI provides a  unique and intuitive visual representation of bullish and bearish  trends, offering unparalleled insights into market dynamics.

The core principle of the PFI is its ability to identify and categorize  market conditions into two primary formations: the 'Bullish Shaft' and  the 'Bearish Shaft.' The Bullish Shaft formation signifies strong upward  momentum and investor confidence, typically indicating a potential  buying opportunity. Conversely, the Bearish Shaft formation signals  downward pressure and growing investor pessimism, suggesting a possible  selling or shorting opportunity.

Institutions employing the PFI in their analysis benefit from its  simplicity and effectiveness. The clear and unmistakable shapes allow  for rapid assessment of market conditions, enabling traders and analysts  to make swift and informed decisions. Moreover, the PFI integrates  seamlessly with other technical indicators and analysis techniques,  enhancing its reliability and predictive power.

The Phallic Formation Indicator has gained widespread adoption among  hedge funds, investment banks, and asset management firms, who value its  innovative approach to market analysis. Its ability to cut through  market noise and provide clear, actionable signals has made it an  indispensable tool in the arsenal of institutional traders and analysts  worldwide.

(Reuters) - Jabil Inc has placed Chief Executive Officer Kenneth Wilson on a paid leave since April 15 pending completion of an investigation related to corporate policies, the electronic components maker said on Thursday.

The company appointed its current CFO Michael Dastoor as the interim CEO, effective April 19, according to its regulatory filing.

Jabil pointed to the filing in response to a request seeking more details on why Wilson was placed on leave.

Wilson was named CEO in November 2022, succeeding Mark Mondello, and assumed the role on May 1, 2023.

The company had last year announced that it would reduce headcount as part of its restructuring plan, estimating to recognize about $300 million in pre-tax restructuring and other related costs through fiscal year 2024.

725,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Jack Henry & Associates,128,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

South Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity
Reuters 2024-04-13T14:47:00-04:00
April 13 (Reuters) - South Africa's health regulator said on Saturday it is recalling batches of Johnson & Johnson's (JNJ.NaE) children's cough syrup after detection of high levels of diethylene glycol.

The affected batches were sold in South Africa, Eswatini, Rwanda, Kenya, Tanzania and Nigeria, the statement added.

The recall follows a report by the regulator's Nigerian counterpart on Wednesday, which first detected the toxin in a batch of Benylin Paediatric Syrup.

Kenya and Nigeria have already issued recalls for the same syrup, which is used in the treatment of hay fever and other allergic conditions affecting the upper respiratory tract.

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

I‚Äôve been diving deep into the options market and found what seems to be an overlooked opportunity with SWAV (Shockwave Medical, Inc.).

This situation seems particularly interesting for the 4/19 $330 calls. Considering the acquisition price and SWAV‚Äôs current trading price, these calls appear to be trading at a bargain.

South Africa recalls J&J's cough syrup sold in six African nations after suspected toxicity

Kenvue (KVUE.NaE), which now owns the Benylin brand after a spin-off from J&J last year, did not immediately respond to a Reuters request for comment.

High levels of diethylene glycol in cough syrup has been linked to the deaths of dozens of children in Gambia, Uzbekistan and Cameroon since 2022 in one of the world's worst waves of poisoning from oral medication. (Reporting by Utkarsh Shetti in Bengaluru Editing by Nick Zieminski)

After some research, I found OKLO‚Äôs Media and Public relations officer is out on maturity probably explaining the lack of attention I would expect a merger of this scale to get. 

Regardless I still think this is under covered and has gone vastly unappreciated for its potential. I don‚Äôt know if it‚Äôll reach the heights of 40s like some of Altman‚Äôs alts claim, but I do believe 20-30 isn‚Äôt unreasonable if it finally gets some goddamn traction with the media.

On the flip side I wonder is Sam Altman‚Äôs name really not big enough to have the predicted multiplying effect on the price everyone claims it will have.

Last quarter's actual earnings per share was 0.3 . The estimates for tomorrow's earnings are coming close to the 0.21 per share quarterly dividend that KeyCorp Bank issues to its common stock shareholders.

In the event that the earnings per share falls below expectations, the company will cut dividends. The company has not cut dividends since 2008.

KeyCorp Bank will likely announce the date for June earnings release on the second Thursday of May, and would probably wait until that time to announce any dividend cuts if the reported earnings look bad.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

Continuing the search for more insights into the current Semiconductor market, as posted in an earlier [Reddit-post](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0fhna/semiconductor_titans_visualized_a_chain_of/), I have come across an interested article with a more detailed breakdown from November last year.

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

*Financials Overview:*
	‚Ä¢	2024 sales projection: $6.88B, increasing to $7.27B in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	Net income expected to rise from $856M in 2024 to $953M in 2025.
	‚Ä¢	P/E ratios indicate fair valuation at 17.1 (2024) and 15.3 (2025).

*Market Presence:*

	‚Ä¢	Dominant player in the global frozen potato market.


*ERP System Challenges:*
	‚Ä¢	ERP implementation impacted Q3 results, affecting net income and Adjusted EBITDA.
	‚Ä¢	Short-term operational disruptions and financial impact are notable.

*Risks:*
	‚Ä¢	Immediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.
	‚Ä¢	Client dependency could pose strategic risks.

*Outlook:*
	‚Ä¢	Despite short-term challenges, particularly with the ERP system, long-term prospects remain strong.
	‚Ä¢	Solid customer relationships and financial health suggest LW is a viable long-term investment.


Additional analysis:

https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240404698637/en/Lamb-Weston-Reports-Fiscal-Third-Quarter-2024-Results-Updates-Fiscal-Year-2024-Outlook

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.

741,Liquidated My Entire Portfolio Today - Here's Why (w/ Due Diligence & Citations),wallstreetbets,Live Nation Entertainment,537,511,26-04-2024 04:29:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdceq4/liquidated_my_entire_portfolio_today_heres_why_w/,"Today, I trusted my gut after months of contemplating, and I liquidated my entire portfolio. Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.
* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say ""wow, my savings are losing value""; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to. Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up. When you lose 25% of your purchasing power and live paycheck to paycheck, you are forced to adjust your lifestyle or take on incremental debt. 
   * Off the last bullet, [credit card debt is at an all time high](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-debt-record-high/), and [credit card delinquency is worst on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/credit-card-delinquency-rates-were-worst-on-record-in-fed-study?embedded-checkout=true). Here are some quick stats: 49% of credit card holders carry a balance month to month, credit card delinquencies have soared more than 50% in the past year, and 6.4% of all accounts are now 90 days past due, and the average credit card annual percentage rate is at a record 20.74%.
   * Further, [buy now pay later (""BNPL"") service usage hit an all time high this past holiday season](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/21/buy-now-pay-later-shoppers-deal-with-holiday-debt.html%23:~:text%3DDuring%2520the%2520season%252C%2520buy%2520now,nearly%252043%2525%252C%2520Adobe%2520said.&ved=2ahUKEwicy7K_9N6FAxVAhIkEHRLMB58QFnoECA8QAw&usg=AOvVaw0Gm5tpilHUFvMEbNeu8NnN). 
   * Finally, [78.9% of federal student loan balances are on forbearance or default status as of 4/18/2024 which accounts for 71.5% of borrowers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/).
* [Basics like food are up multiples](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58350). No need to explain further, we have all been to the grocery store and felt this.
* Homes are completely unaffordable / [the cost of buying a home has hit an all time high](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1090/redfin-reports-buying-a-home-costs-more-than-ever-with), as such, home ownership is becoming less feasible and millennials / Gen Z are not building equity in what has historically been American's most valuable asset.
* [Child care is skyrocketing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-threat-that-high-childcare-costs-pose-to-the-us-economy-124248273.html). The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-22986/child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf-program) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income; however, that figure is roughly 24%. [Bank of America said the average childcare payment per household has risen over 30% since 2019 for its customers](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.html). We are at a point where some families are determining if they are better off to become a single income household versus a dual income household with child care.
* While the USD still remains the most dominant force (by a significant margin), regardless of opinion on sanctions, sanctions typically lead to weakening the USD. Further, nations are considering moving away from the USD more now than ever before. So much so that [political candidates are discussing potential penalties for nations that move away from the USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize?embedded-checkout=true). 
* [GDP missed estimates this morning at 1.6% versus estimates of 2.2%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/us-gdp-first-quarter-report).
* Finally, not to mention all of the chaos going on in the world right now. Conflict in Eastern Europe, conflict in the Middle East, the US border crisis, China & Taiwan, etc.

All the while, we are being told that everything is fine! There is nothing to worry about! This is the soft landing we have been looking for, and inflation is normalizing...right?

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

After adding a few more exponential moving averages and a 9 period volume oscillator it had come to my attention that my ICT hypothesis was coming into fruition and thereafter I calculated that I'd get a return of at least 17500% minimum by session closing on Thursday the 32nd of June.

After seeing a break of the linear regression trendline structure, I went to the 12 hour timeframe to make sure the candle closed outside of the parabolic support area before placing my trade. I didn't see it there but I did see it on the 3 minute timeframe so that was good enough for me. As soon as the price crossed the upper range of the williams fractal index with an increase in order flow, everything had finally come together and the setup had presented itself nicely. I wasted no time and decided to sell most of my possession's and put it into this trade which I understand is a no no but I was sure this time. I position sized appropriately and went all in a market order at 143x leveraged hedged position going long with a 1:175 risk to reward ratio and a stoploss at the recent swing low.

While I waited for my order to hit my take profit and feeling optimistic about my position, I opened up a new tab in my browser and began customizing the brand new lamborghini I was about to order. It took me about 15 minutes to finish then I added to cart. Now that I was ready, I decided to take a quick look back on the progress only to find that my position had been liquidated. My only mistake was that the liquidation price was set above my stoploss so that was hit first. Actually the other mistake was that I went long when I should have gone short (avoid this). All of this has left me devastated and I have come to realize that trading just isn't possible and the only way to profit from this is by selling courses."
746,Attempting An Earnings Play Marathon,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,161,123,04-05-2024 12:38:01,https://i.redd.it/bsdb6qaymeyc1.jpeg,"Have you ever dreamed of taking your small portfolio to over multiple six figures in just one trading week? Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. 

Earnings Marathon
Full Port Every Time - This is a Million Dollar Week!

Week 1:
Tesla - Calls
Meta - Puts
Google- Calls

Week 2:
MSTR: Puts
SMCI & AMD: Puts
Carvana: Calls
Apple: Calls

Week 3:
Monday after close / Tuesday before open
Palantir, Disney: 

Tuesday after close / Wednesday before open
Arista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: 

Wednesday after close / Thursday before open
Arm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:

Thursday after close / Friday before open
Mara, Soundhound:

These are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.

My Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50. 

Thanks for taking the time to read this, let‚Äôs get it!

747,Calls for earnings - buy high IV near term calls or low IV far out calls,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,4,12,03-05-2024 22:00:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cjkesw/calls_for_earnings_buy_high_iv_near_term_calls_or/,"So next week PLTR, HOOD, and HIMS have earnings. Now, I have calls expiring 5/10 for each of them as I expect these stocks to rise after earnings. My current position is as follows:

PLTR - 5x 22.5c@1.8
HOOD - 5x 17c@1.37, 5x 17.5c@0.9
HIMS - 10x 12.5c@0.8, 10x 13.5c@0.5c

Now, I was looking at other options for these calls and I am wondering if I should rather roll over my calls into them instead. For PLTR, I saw 7/19 24c with similar price to my current 22.5c. For HOOD, I saw 6/21 18c and 8/16 20c with similar price to my current 17c. For HIMS, I saw 7/19 13c with similar price to my 12.5c and 7/19 14c with similar price to my 13.5c

The options I am looking at expire in 2.5 months. This will enable me to buy them currently at very less IV and would potentially also save me from IV crush post earnings. Since the SP for the calls is similar to the ones I currently hold (HOOD ones are a bit higher SP tho), I think the profit difference should not be much if the stock does move in my favored direction. However, I think it will very likely reduce my risk if stock moves in opposite direction (my 5/10 calls might go to 0 if this happens whereas far out calls will still have some value, and the stock might even recover by then to make up any losses). Should I actually rollover my calls into the above mentioned calls (or better calls if I can find them) or should I let them be and pray the stocks move much higher for me to profit big?"
748,Is Starbucks SBUX an immediate BUY?,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,5,65,03-05-2024 15:37:52,https://i.redd.it/s3k331p4e8yc1.jpeg,"SBUX shares dropped nearly 16% yesterday following their earnings release for fiscal Q2 which was worse than anticipated and marked a historically weak quarter. Starbucks was already in the Unfavored zone of the SIA S&P 100 Index Report and fell 7 more spots yesterday to the 100th ranking out of 103 investments. Starbucks has been in the Unfavored zone since June of last year and is down around -25% during this time period. 

US same-store sales dropped by 3% compared to an expectation of more than 1.2% as cautious consumer spending and a deteriorating economic environment weighed on customer traffic. Similarly, China experienced a decline of 11% in sales against an expected 2%. Operational margin stood at 12.8%, lower than the expected 14.4%, with EPS at $0.68 compared to the expected $0.80. Global revenue growth is pegged at low-single digits, compared with the previous guidance for a 7% to 10% gain. The retailer also forecasts global comparable store sales to be flat to down by low-single digits, compared with prior expectations for 4% to 6% growth. The company's long-term growth depends on several sales drivers and correcting some recent actions, as well as implementing cost efficiency measures according to analysts. Looking at a candlestick chart over the last five years using weekly time periods, we can see SBUX gap down significantly on the earnings miss yesterday marking the largest one week drop in this time frame. This has continued its recent trend downwards from its all-time highs from July of 2021 and its recent one year high from May of 2023. We could see support just below the $70 level based on previous lows from the spring of 2022 and past moves.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is currently in a column of 17 O's in a 2% Point and Figure chart which represents around a 35% drawdown while filtering out the short term noise. To the downside, support can now be found at around $70 and below this at $65.85 which corresponds to the lows from 2022 and the summer of 2020."

Unless they create OPEC for weed production and make it impossible to grow, there is no industry.

The point of growing your own is irrelevant. The costs are too high, the prices are too low. Inevitable oversturation. Has happened in every market so far. There are no millionaires in the weed like people imagine. It‚Äôs bums struggling to survive.

So recently to save the bank from failing shareholder got diluted 70%+ with more dilution on the horizon via warrants. That dilution itself would be sufficient explanation for its current price. Instead they posted an all time terrible 4q2023 earnings. 

Well 1q2024 is in and it‚Äôs bad. Excluding write downs losses accelerated from 187 million to 327 million q/q or a jump of 75%. I guess all of that dilution saves you so eps is only a loss of 45c share.  Worst of all that‚Äôs a loss of 45c per share after selling their best loans meaning losses next quarter are almost guaranteed to be worse. Net interest income down 16% q/q. Net interest margin down 54 basis points q/q (that‚Äôs a 20% NIM drop in a single quarter). 27% Revenue drop q/q and 76.2% drop y/y.   Non interest income went from 127M last quarter to 9M this quarter. Non performing loans jumped 86.5% q/q. Allowance for credit losses jumped 21% q/q.

Overall these are terrible numbers but to have this bad of a q/q results after an all time bad quarter is scary so they need to show those losses decelerating very soon otherwise anymore capital flight and they could go under. I don‚Äôt personally expect them to fail but if you have shares I‚Äôd use any low volume pre market pump to get out. This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze opportunity and they just proved the road to meeting even yesterday‚Äôs valuation is probably over 2 years away. Be wary I‚Äôve seen plenty of big pops on earnings before the market opens evaporate when real investors start selling at open.

Edit: One last thought. It to me feels shady that they really rushed this earnings (13 hour notice) into the morning of an fomc meeting. This is most likely because many regionals used the most rosy legally allowable prediction of two rate cuts in their 2024 forward looking statements and I‚Äôm sure Otting wanted to do the same instead of waiting a week or 2 and having to be only able to factor in one or zero.

Stagflation, high inflation. How many times do I have to tell you mfer regards CPI is going up. April's CPI is 3.5% forecast now, it might go up a bit by CPI and the last CPI prints came in .1% higher than the estimates. So April's CPI can come out to 3.6-3.7%. Gas prices will sky rocket in summer that will cause CPI to be close to 5% again. They'll have no option but to hike interest rates up again.

Stocks are gonna crash to 2022 level lows once again. I would hold SQQQ, SOXS, oil stocks or healthcare stocks like UNH or LLY until the lows are hit. Then invest in TQQQ or SOXL after we hit the lows. Or invest in SGOV when interest rates hit 6-7%.

  
If you had bought SOXS or SQQQ when I suggested it early this month. You'd be up 28% on SOXS and 17% on SQQQ."

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**."

759,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves",wallstreetbets,Lowe's,443,356,29-04-2024 05:59:33,https://i.redd.it/g884d41bzcxc1.jpeg,"OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple."
761,Mouse Ear Puts FTW ($DIS),wallstreetbets,Lowe's,21,58,28-04-2024 20:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cffwf2/mouse_ear_puts_ftw_dis/,"Mouse Ears Puts FTW ($DIS)

Happy Sunday!

Not terribly long ago I was ridiculed for suggesting $SNAP calls could make you money even though my approach was to exit prior to ER. I can‚Äôt be right twice, so here goes nothing‚Ä¶.

Securing $DIS puts first thing Monday to me is an absolute low risk effort to not only scalp some nice gains but also achieve those baggers y‚Äôall like instead of being bagholders.

I already missed out on scoring these on the cheap early April as I was too busy being a regard elsewhere. Luckily the IV on contracts expiring 5/10 (after ER mind you) are still quite low and I expect IV to throttle up to 150% or more by this time next week. 

While the mouse ears is great at screwing bears over, my sound bullet proof reasoning is below:

- they just secured a proxy ‚Äúvictory‚Äù which is anything but to me. It shows blood in the water and hostility, not to mention doubt that their current leadership can actually power through and make them the blue chip they once were.

- they have had an awful run at the box office lately. While I think the FUTURE releases of movies bodes well for them longer term, I see this as a very reasonable and logical place for Wall Street to knock them down a rung without giving too much value into forward movie guidance.

- Bob Iger is a gap filler IMO. I don‚Äôt know how any long term shareholder of this company for the last 5 years could be excited compared to the rest of the market.

- they throttled way up last earnings. In line with other stocks it seems like a balance of once blessed and once cursed, which will happen when they enter ER. 

- IV will continue to increase leading up to earnings, which will help all contracts in value.

- I expect this week to be a red week and not pushing 52W H, so I would like to see DIS move to $105 by EOW ideally. Oh yeah FOMC this week too!

The play:

$105p 5/10 exp. Available for a cool $1 or so with great opportunity to not only be ITM prior to earnings but also along with the kick in IV to see a nice 60-200% increase in value without even playing the ER call.

My position: will comment Monday AM when I secure position.

My exit: if I double by EOW I will sell at least half and let the rest ride.

Prediction: $DIS to $93 by 5/10, probably 5/9. If my prediction is correct, it will make those $105 puts be worth well more than 10x what they are now.

Best of luck!"

You might wonder how I ended up in this erm, position. 

*record scratch*

For the sake of amusement and educational value, I certainly hope some of you might learn from my mistakes instead of stepping on the same rake.

It all began a few weeks ago.

https://preview.redd.it/5dbpqb1u65xc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14416697d69805e00b82eb53b072617b20a466dd

I got greedy. And greedy people make mistakes.

When Trump's Truth Social became a public company with the shittiest fundamentals known to mankind, no business plan and staggering losses, it was a no-brainer to short it. I learned options just so I could!

And the money was good. My first short had an expiration date of Jan 2025 and the strike price was $25. But because of all the greeks and short interest I sold it at a profit when DJT traded over $30! Wild. It retained its value so well because of long expiration date (theta).

Then I did some other trades, most of them reasonably successful and briefly my account went above $200k. That gave me a sense of false confidence. Easy money! Why, I could just make a thousand dollars a day shorting this thing and calling that thing. I just need a bit more practice. Right?

What I realized is that some options turn a profit in seconds and others can take days and weeks. And 1% for a minute of your time is better returns than 15% after two weeks of incubation.

Then I noticed that of all the trades I made the one that persistently delivered was DJT. It just kept sliding down on a schedule. It had places to be, somewhere between $0 and $2, as it seemed at the time.

So I yolod over 40k on a bet I thought would take a day or two at most. And to make it more profitable I reduced the expiration date to only a couple of weeks, so I could get more contracts for the price.

And then DJT shot up, changing trajectory that has been very predictable up to that point.

Why? Because it trades on sentiment, not fundamentals. Because market conditions. Because boohoo some evil hedgefund managers buy up shares so they can sell shorts and the low trade volume makes it easy to manipulate the stock price? BULLSHIT. These are self-delusions and lies. I don't know why, and never will, because I'm a retail trader and not an institution. 

THE EASIEST LIE IS THE ONE YOU TELL YOURSELF.

I can do my own research, sure, but I don't have the time to make it a full time job. Because of this, I will not have all the information that professionals have at their disposal. I hardly know what questions to ask.

A couple days later, looking at DJT (it should bounce down any day now!) I bought another put, this time aiming for $29 (it was trading around $30). I think they call it 'revenge trading' or 'emotional trading'. Don't do that.

Don't double down on a bad bet. Our brains use a lot of cheat codes to make snap decisions in stressful situations. We get adrenaline, our hearts start racing, our palms start sweating and our brains shut down higher brain functions to improve reaction time, known as 'fight or flight' response. It's great for hunting tigers and wolves. It's a really bad idea to do this when math is involved. And our tech is evolving faster than our bodies.

If you think you might be getting upset and not thinking things through, it's time to stop for the day and come back to it in the morning.

What else? Don't bet more than 10% of your port on any one company or event. Diversify. 

If you keep betting an increasing amount of money, no matter how certain the odds are, eventually the revolver drum will find the one bullet that will take you out in the Russian roulette you build out of your option contract. You're building a mouse trap to catch yourself, so uh, pad the walls a little. Make it a bit comfy.

As for me, I think my best option (teehee) is to fold and liquidate those bets on Monday on the best terms I can find, so I stop chasing the sunk cost fallacy and invest in something that can be more predictable in turning a profit. But I'm open to suggestions! I can't say that it's not tempting to let my puts ride all the way to $0. Part of me keeps wondering if it sinks down to 28 this week for no reason at all. But I also recognize this as a stage of grief known as 'bargaining'. 

I also believe DJT is still a penny stock that will go to $2 in September when Trump cashes out his cut and the price goes down, but my contracts don't have that long. Until September, it will fluctuate wildly, 1-15% a day in either direction as foreign interests and local patriots press buttons to make the money machine go brrr for fun and profit.

Could I straddle it and make some money back? Sure, but there are safer ways to make money right now and I'm going to focus on things with higher probabilities of success. 

This was the most expensive lesson of my life and if you read this far, you got it for free. You're welcome.

So stop munching on those crayons and think about contingency plans instead of throwing all your money on the next ""sure thing"". Options give you higher profits but there is a cost. And that cost is, you can lose everything. When a share price goes down, shares usually don't drop 30% in a day. 

So if you don't want your epitaph to be ""expired worthless"", think a little harder and double check the dates before you piss your money and metaphors against the wind.

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now

* Fall in phone sales especially in China
* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year.
* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.
* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)
* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)
* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense

However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.

Install Base & Great Product recognition

Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.

Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?

AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.

~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~

Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)

The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. 

As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.

Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.

Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.

All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.

Look for Apple to begin that story this June.

765,Enovix corp (ENVX),wallstreetbets,Lowe's,127,140,26-04-2024 09:03:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdgo4v/enovix_corp_envx/,"Energy materials scientist here. I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.

# TL;DR:

Enovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.

# Financials and stonk mommy moves:

* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say ""bankruptcy,"" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.
* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.
* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.
* **Manufacturing muscle**: They‚Äôre expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.
* **Strategic alliances**: They‚Äôve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.

# Tech specs and market hype:

* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.
* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there‚Äôs a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.

# Bottom Line:

Enovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It‚Äôs a textbook high-risk, high-reward play. They could be the garden gnome that wins the Iron Throne that tech investors have been praying for to lead the next big wave in battery technology. Or, they could go down in flames as a cautionary tale of overreach and under-delivery. Personally, I'm bullish and have shares and calls.

Notice the heavy selling on 3/20 once price hit $3000. Looming 50:1 stock split is not until June so no worries about the poors pumping the stock. 

**Catalyst:**
Earnings today after close. As you may know, California recently raised its minimum wage for chain fast food companies to $20/hr, and it just took effect beginning of April. Chipotle has had to raise its prices there (again), and now people are paying $12-15 for a gentrified burrito. With the repeated price increases and the possible staff reductions, Becky might decide to visit an actual Mexican restaurant. California makes up 14% of their locations, so while this will not end their bloodline, I believe they may update their guidance in this earnings call. Whoever the hell is buying at this price is paying out 5-7 years worth of potential growth in advance. 

**Hedge Funds:**
Ackman reduced position in Q4 2023, and it's not yet known if he sold any in Q1 2024 yet because 13F's are not out yet. Maybe that was him on 3/20?

**Potential risks:**

‚Ä¢ Price increases may lead to increased revenue if people don't stop coming in.

‚Ä¢ They may use minimum wage as an excuse to reduce staff, reducing payroll costs to slave drive the shit out of 1 remaining worker behind the counter, leading to possible increased earnings.

I suspect we will see a pressure release as the summer goes on, but despite low expectations, things can actually get worse.  I don't believe we will see an uptick in number of planes they are getting out and I also believe their unit costs are increasing not reducing

- Defense: this will see some improvement. Not enough to offset still terrible fixed cost contracts.  It will take the rest of the year to work through. I believe BA is losing out on some lucrative contracts due to all the distractions and noise 

- Services: it's fine, but can't bail two big deadweights

Now that the hang-over from the SAG-AFTRA strike is mostly behind us, we've already begun the summer blockbuster upswing.  IMAX is up 10% in the last 30 days.  Make no mistake -- the first quarter was dreadful for the box office -- down 20% in YoY comparison.  And theater operators like IMAX are feeling it.  But if you look under the covers, it's not as bad as it seems (or could have been).  The SAG-AFTRA strike pushed a lot of movies further out leaving plenty of holes in the movie slate for Q1.  And even without a strike, very few movies were going to compete with the numbers that Avatar 2 put up this time last year. But the good news is -- IMAX CORRECTLY PREDICTED THIS BOX OFFICE SLOWDOWN, lowering their guidance and revenue expectations dramatically going into tomorrow's Q1 earnings release.   In fact, I think they lowered them too much, and I would not be surprised to see a nice earnings surprise and bump in the stock price.  Regardless, the forward guidance for Q2 and beyond should be exciting -- the movie slate is jam-packed with summer tentpoles and I'm confident IMAX will be trading in the low to mid $20s soon enough.  And don't even get me started on the 2025 box office.....that's when industry experts believe we'll be back in pre-pandemic levels. But I'm pretty sure the stock will have recovered from these lows well before then.  Get your popcorn out!"

The revenue has trippled since 2020. Yet the stock price has taken a nosedive since the IPO. And it's not like gaming will become less relevant in the future, quite the opposite imo.

The company is not profitable yet but the price to sales and the price to book ratios are extremely low.

I know they had a bit of a shitstorm last year but the stock price was already low before that and I don't think it fundamentally changed anything.

Thoughts?

Edit: I just looked up the number of employees and I'm shocked to find they have over 6,000 employees. Even with a 25% layoff it's hard to fathom how a game engine can warrant that many employees. Obvious potential for cost reduction there. Even Epic Games doesn't have that many employees and they develop games on top of developing a game engine."

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon‚Äôs plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that‚Äôs not a good working plan. As I understand, there‚Äôs a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I‚Äôm still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

776,Making the Case for Cabaletta Bio (CABA),wallstreetbets,Lowe's,10,6,23-04-2024 04:48:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1caw29j/making_the_case_for_cabaletta_bio_caba/,"Quick overview of their relevant stats:

Free Float ‚Äì 44.7M
Market Cap ‚Äì $642M
Technology ‚Äì CAR-T therapy

Targets/Indications ‚Äì Lupus, Myositis, Systemic Sclerosis, mucosal pemphigus Vulgaris, and Myasthenia Gravis (all of them are scary debilitating diseases).

Runway until mid-26‚Äô, and a stated intention to find ‚Äústrategic partnership(s)‚Äù.

Two short-term clinical trial readouts for Lupus (SLE) and Myositis.


The Science:

CAR-T therapies for oncological targets have been all the craze in medicine in the recent past, and in particular, blood cancers.  It‚Äôs not a new treatment, but now it‚Äôs being used to treat indications that are not cancer.  

Cells from the patient are taken in a blood draw.  They are then mixed with a virus that easily infects human cells.  The virus itself does not carry any genetic information of the virus; it carries the genetic information on how to identify and kill a B-cell.  The ‚Äúinfected‚Äù cells that now carry the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genetic targeting information are then put into a media where they can grow.  Once they reach an optimal population, they are put back into the patient.  These ‚ÄúCAR-T‚Äù cells then kill off the problematic B-cells in the patient‚Äôs body for a prolonged period of time, and then the patient‚Äôs B-cells repopulate months/years down the road without them engaging in an autoimmune response (attacking/killing the good cells).  

Without sounding like a big salesman for the company (I have no affiliation with the company), there have been striking results published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  It‚Äôs important to note that this Journal has a very high standard of publishing quality data.  They have shown that the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù (genetic bits that go into the CAR-T cell) will effectively kill off the autoimmune-related B-cells that are hurting the patient, and that there will be a ‚Äúdurable‚Äù effect on the patient (+2 years).  The technology was born out of U-Penn and Oxford and they are partnered with WuXi to scale their initial products.


The stock:

With very little news, the stock peaked around $25 and change.  It has since flittered back down to the low teens and has been bumping around some support lines.  The usual shorting (21% of free float), but nothing too crazy going on.  The analysts SP forecast range is from $25 - $50.  Their corporate slide deck says that they will have their first clinical readouts for both Lupus and Myositis during the first half of this year and we‚Äôre nearly late-April right now.  They will have a second readout during the second half.  Seeing that the stock has a relatively low float for a non-commercialized biotech, any good news would propel the SP, and based on the published data so far, it seems like a probable positive outcome, but yeah, Science is tricky sometimes.

I have a handful of near the money July calls, but I do believe that it would jack up above $20 on good data.  I may buy a few far out of the money calls in July too if the data haven‚Äôt been released in early June.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

Monday :  Truist and Zions reports. This will be a good test for the health of Regional Banks & commercial Real estate. TFC and Zion expected earnings both to decline 26%. A good beat will be a healthy a sign.

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It‚Äôll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. 
 
Friday:  The Fed‚Äôs favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.

780,$MARA is about to explode,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,171,339,21-04-2024 11:37:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c9fri7/mara_is_about_to_explode/,"Despite a massive bull run for bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have lagged significantly.  The halving may be a reminder for spot holders that their asset won't be inflated away, but it's also a warning for miners that their income stream is being cut in half every four years.  If you're new to bitcoin, the bitcoin miners have two sources of revenue: transaction fees, and block rewards.

Historically, most of the revenue for bitcoin miners has come from the block rewards, ie the new bitcoin being created by the protocol.  The block rewards were cut in half on 4/20, aka the halvening.  Fees don't make much money for miners:

&#x200B;

[bitcoin fees as a &#37; of total block rewards](https://preview.redd.it/b0ddnytabtvc1.png?width=1353&format=png&auto=webp&s=34652730f25848f864830e86404ed0115ff0fb95)

As you can see, user fees as a percent of miner revenue has been close to zero for most of bitcoin's history.  Since the block subsidy is being cut in half every four years, the future appears grim for the bitcoin miners.  Wall Street rates them holds or sells.  But what's that historically huge spike we just saw on 4/20?  That, my fellow regards, was caused by the *Runes* protocol, which went live along with the halving.

Long story short, Runes is an attempt to bring NFTs to Bitcoin.  Anyone paying attention to crypto at all the past couple years will know the potential mania that might come with this.  It hints that bitcoin could be a long-term threat to Ethereum, something most analysts don't consider, and it's causing a dramatic surge in demand for bitcoin block space right now.

Here's the realtime bitcoin fee data:

&#x200B;

[recent bitcoin transaction fees intraday](https://preview.redd.it/optlsmkvctvc1.png?width=745&format=png&auto=webp&s=e2fcd990ab19a029c3e45e9c23d84460bcafdd58)

You can see that fees per block have moved substantially higher post-halving, compared with the previous week, a period that was already showing elevated user fees compared with bitcoin's history.  The demand for bitcoin block space is increasing exponentially, and this bodes well for bitcoin's future.

$MARA Marathon Digital is the market cap leader in bitcoin mining, and has been very profitable as bitcoin has been going up.  EPS of $1.08 in the past year, low debt to equity, all with bitcoin at prices well below current levels.  Meanwhile, US bitcoin ETFs have been the most successful launch in history.  ETFs were just approved in Hong Kong as well.  Bitcoin will be the world's first global money.  Now with Runes, the narrative that the miners will struggle because nobody actually uses bitcoin will take a serious hit.  So you're going to see three things happening simultaneously in the next quarter:

&#x200B;

1. the bitcoin price is going to rip higher, as high net worth individuals and small companies start allocating assets to bitcoin, following a still-building wave of Wall Street marketing, helped by...
2. ... the anti-bitcoin narrative that miners can't be profitable long-term and therefore the asset security model is broken takes a big hit, since...
3. ... demand for block space will be rising significantly, providing a much rosier outlook for the long-term future of bitcoin miners which will lead to ...
4. ... analyst upgrades, as bitcoin miners will be reporting record earnings due to increased fees and rapidly rising bitcoin price

&#x200B;

With earnings going up AND P/E multiples widening, the upside potential for $MARA is huge.  Now the cherry on top, the grim outlook for miners has created a significant short interest of 18% of the float, \~43 million shares short. 

&#x200B;

[significant short interest in $MARA](https://preview.redd.it/valuc5yritvc1.png?width=508&format=png&auto=webp&s=f92dbbbc19aecdf5f262089436e2f269d30289db)

Between a new wave of insane bitcoiners FOMO'ing into NFTs at any price, shorts covering, and legitimately increasing revenue and prospects for the company, imo this one is a firecracker set to pop.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble, ie \~1995‚Äì2002, and to my surprise, this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive, but every few days, the trend would reverse. 

For example, Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3%, 4%, 1%, 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21, 1999, then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up, and on the way down, as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day, algo-driven markets."

I don‚Äôt have any attachment to that stock if I get called cuz I am always selling $7+ out of the money and I don‚Äôt mind having that weekly income while it‚Äôs low. Just wondering if anyone got any advice for this strategy and if it‚Äôs viable strategy. I also figure Tesla is secure enough company to put your money into like that since a lot of ETFs hold it too. And all the income from selling tesla calls I‚Äôll just put into growth ETFs and stuff like JEPQ with moderate income.

Israel was demonstrating force capability in regions with critical targets, they avoided nuclear/civilian targets which would have been extremely escalatory. Middle east conflict could still escalate but if anything, this strike made it *less* likely that it would happen tomorrow. If the casualty count is low/zero, its further proof Israel was demonstrating capability, not truly attacking. My guess is that this is why futures aren't tanking further.

Looks like [3 drones were shot down over Isfahan](https://aje.io/akzdf6?update=2846016), an important nuclear research/weapons development city. Israel might have been showing Iran that they could hit them if they want to. This after Iran showed the opposite, that even \~600 munitions can't meaningfully get to Israel. So this whole thing might have been Israel shooting at nothing 2 miles from a strategically significant target to prove to Iran they could get to a bunch of important military targets if they needed to. That could put to rest the current pressure for retaliation in Israel without forcing Iran to do the same. Especially if the casualty count is zero; there's no need for Iran to respond.

Still, medium and long term this isn't great for middle east geopolitical stability but if it was WW3 time, the news would be different. My 2 cents

Amongst my friends, everyone mentions Bumble and Hinge as the best dating apps.  At a $1.8B market cap, I could see a company like Google or Meta wanting to acquire Bumble.

This stock is now trading below it‚Äôs cash value of $9.58 per share.  The company actually has more cash on their balance sheet than they have market cap.

Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA

Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."

791,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,129,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

792,Palantir ($PLTR): Preview of Possible Massive Commercial Expansion Ahead of Upcoming Earnings - Part 3 - DD,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,15,35,17-04-2024 20:05:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6jprd/palantir_pltr_preview_of_possible_massive/,"Palantir has consistently offered robust and sophisticated software solutions, but deployment challenges have previously hindered widespread adoption. Recently, however, the company has introduced its Artificial Intelligence Platform (AIP) product and bootcamp training programs, enabling faster and more streamlined implementation for customers. These initiatives have allowed some clients to emerge from the bootcamps with functional, value-adding products, addressing the deployment bottleneck that had previously constrained Palantir's exponential growth. With these advancements, the company is well-positioned to accelerate adoption and capitalize on the strength of its software offerings. I'm expecting big numbers on May 6th, 2024.

# Previously reported growth rates which were ok:

[Previously Reported Growth Rates](https://preview.redd.it/ilj8y4jpg3vc1.png?width=858&format=png&auto=webp&s=0fc6fcca44b94923450e6171dce5ccf79798228c)

# Analysis on projected commercial growth:

Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) companies often employ subdomains to isolate and manage their clients' data and resources. By tracking the number of subdomains associated with a SaaS product, one can gain insight into its adoption rate and growth trajectory. Based on my analysis of subdomain data over an extended period, it appears that Palantir, a prominent data analytics firm, is poised for substantial growth in its customer base and market presence.

&#x200B;

[Estimate based on subdomain analysis](https://preview.redd.it/j0qilgg5h3vc1.png?width=975&format=png&auto=webp&s=2e6f73baf83f97e48ebae61a0f27b3e0593a0af1)

&#x200B;

 

Even if only half of the additions turn into permanent customers these numbers are going to be massive.

**Here is what I used for the source data of subdomain data:**

[https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com](https://subdomainfinder.c99.nl/scans/2024-04-15/palantirfoundry.com)

First, I extracted the data relevant for the analysis‚Äîsubdomains for each snapshot‚Äîand then calculated how many new customers appeared in Q1 2024.

In Q1 2024, Palantir acquired a total of 333 new customers. The monthly breakdown was as follows:

‚Ä¢	January: 81 new customers

‚Ä¢	February: 105 new customers

‚Ä¢	March: 147 new customers

This showed an increasing trend in customer acquisition as the quarter progressed. To forecast the number of new customers for Q2 2024, I used this growth trend. I calculated the monthly growth rates and applied them to predict the number of new customers in the upcoming months of Q2 2024.

For Q2 2024, the projected number of new customers for Palantir, based on the growth rates from Q1 2024, was as follows:

‚Ä¢	April: Approximately 198 new customers

‚Ä¢	May: Approximately 267 new customers

‚Ä¢	June: Approximately 360 new customers

Overall, Palantir was projected to acquire around 826 new customers in Q2 2024. This forecast assumed a consistent growth rate similar to what was observed in Q1 2024. Keep in mind, actual results may vary depending on market conditions, company strategy, and external factors.

I know there‚Äôs been a lot of doom and gloom here lately. So I‚Äôm here to shine a gleaming, silver light of hope onto all of your portfolios. I introduce to you, $SIL and the Election Year Thesis. 

The best theses are always simple. 

Every single election year since 2016 $SIL has ran from low $20 range to high $40 and even $50 range between April and August - EVERY SINGLE Election Year. It is currently on track to do the same exact thing this year. Most of the movement in past election years has occurred in May and June, so now is the perfect time to load up calls. (I personally love $35 7/19 Calls).

Not only does the historical chart for $SIL support this thesis but so does the historical chart for $GOLD and $SILVER ounces. As you can see from the chart below, given current gold prices, silver ounces should already be priced over $40. What this will do for the silver mining stocks will be unprecedented when silver inevitably plays catch up, and that will happen faster than you will believe.

It is time to get your portfolio set for the summer with $SIL calls. Grand times lie ahead. ü•Ç"

Over next few weeks, there will be a once in a 200 year cycle for cicadas, meaning there will be an insane influx of them all around the East/Midwest/south portion of the US. Its estimated that trillions of these cicadas will come crawling out of the ground in droves. The last time this took place was in 1803 when Thomas Jefferson was president.

With a cicada infestation sure to come next, many people are ready to start stocking up on their bug spray. The company with leading market share in this space Scotts Miracle-Gro who owns many companies including Ortho Bug Sprays.

1) Last earnings were reported Feb 21, beating on revenue but losing more money (negative EPS) than expected.

2) Bitcoin? They stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2022. Bitcoin prices have fallen since March but not in such a straight line.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

The objective target for the counter-move is around $510. ( This is a previous level of demand that will now be supply as trapped buyers look to exit )  
My (custom) stochastic & RSI indicators have triggered counter-rally signals. ( outlined with the vertical blue lines )  
Bear in mind the market just broke the 50-day moving average. This nearly always means more pain is ahead. So expect the counter-rally to fail quickly ( very likely on a touch of the 50-day moving average from below)  
After the counter-rally is over the sell off is expected to continue to fill the gap at $497, left there after NVDA reported earnings.  


If we simply open with a gap up tomorrow at $510, then the counter-rally will likely have already concluded.  
It is extremely risky to trade against the trend. I'm not recommending a trade here. Just sharing my work.

I have further out projections for what I expect to happen after $497. Will share in due time.  
Good luck everyone and stay safe.

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

\*\*Positions\*\*

$3k in Puts at price points between $25 and $5 over the next 8 months.

805,PAA - Two Ways to Play in 2024,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,16,18,15-04-2024 16:08:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4q17t/paa_two_ways_to_play_in_2024/,"There are a couple of DD's out there already around PAA (""Drill Baby Drill! Possible 25 Baggers"" AND ""PAA - Why it can go high, even if oil doesn't"") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26. I bought $20C 8/16 and made a quick 330% profit, but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb. I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year, however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4. That's why I think there are two ways this should be played. My current positions are listed at the end of this thread.

Midstream companies benefit when production is high. They have contracts in place with upstream companies, but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down, BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract.¬†Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2.¬†

**Frac Spread**

What is it? Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US. It's a leading indicator of oil production. Midstream companies, like PAA, thrive when production is high.There was an increase in fracture spread in February, but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year/Year), 2024 compared to same time 2023. The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year. Production is way down compared to this time of year. Same with Rig Counts (see below)¬†Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year, same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023.¬† 

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/nzczrcdv1ouc1.png?width=941&format=png&auto=webp&s=5dc206826bda2ea0e001b9281b211dda5a2093dc

**Rig Count** 

What is it? Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada. Again, just like Frac Spread, there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024. 

https://preview.redd.it/yqwfn8vw1ouc1.png?width=932&format=png&auto=webp&s=33519546acc2b3fb95dd24b44a8c0f3101b09b42

[https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024](https://www.aogr.com/web-exclusives/us-frac-spread-count/2024)

Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2, they were relatively low in Q1. Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high. 

https://preview.redd.it/12vr3cky1ouc1.png?width=1081&format=png&auto=webp&s=5b90b053824d847e62fab1a25808a378eda3fcd6

Again, I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year, but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2. Keep an eye on frac spread, rig count, and oil prices. If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year, but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction. AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread, rig count, and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price. I'm just not there yet.  I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction. Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price. ¬†This is not financial advice.¬†Just slightly (perhaps fully) regarded and how I think this will play out this year.

But let me paint you a different picture.

Yes the CPI came in technically hotter than expected, but when you actually dive into the numbers, it tells a different story. The main 3 factors that are causing this higher than 2 percent inflation are 
1. Shelter
2. Electricity 
3. Transportation

Now we‚Äôll look at each individually:
1. Shelter: shelter is calculated on a ‚Äúrenters equivalent‚Äù bullshit term made up to try and fudge the numbers on what people actually pay, but for this explanation, it‚Äôs not that important. What IS important is the fact that shelter is a lagging indicator. When the interest rate hike takes effect, most people don‚Äôt feel the immediate impact of this. Renters have to go through their lease period before rent is raised, and like 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rates so most home owners don‚Äôt feel it either. So shelter being at around 6% is actually the effects of the rate hikes at least 12-18 months prior to this date.

2. Electricity: despite the price of natural gas, coal, and renewable energy all becoming significantly cheaper in the last 4 years, energy prices are up. The only possible explanation to me is profiteering, because there is no reason why with all three of these commodities being so low should electricity be this high. 

3. Transportation: despite its name, one of its largest components is actually car insurance, which has miraculously increased by like 20% yoy because of their ‚Äùfuture modeling‚Äù predicting higher costs to them, which ended up being false. If you check Geico‚Äôs recent quarterly statement, they said they actually had lower costs this year on average. So once again, profiteering.

In the end keeping interest rates high is actually hurting the CPI more by keeping mortgages higher which then translates to higher shelter. Without these 3 CPI numbers, (one of which is a. Lagging and b. Held higher with higher rates while the other two are from profiteering), inflation is already below 2 percent.

TLDR: fed keeping rates higher for no reason because the real data says otherwise "

https://www.federalreserve.gov/monetarypolicy/files/fomcminutes20240320.pdf

Provided by ChatGPT: 

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.

Key highlights from the minutes include:

- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.

- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.

- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.

- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.

In summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data."
816,Pools Closed: Why LESL is Circling the Drain,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,31,22,10-04-2024 16:17:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pinl/pools_closed_why_lesl_is_circling_the_drain/,"What was your first thought when you read Joann Fabrics went bankrupt?  If you're like me, it was: ""Holy shit, I can't believe they weren't bankrupt 10 years ago.""  I started looking for similarly situated companies that the market hasn't finished off yet and it lead me to Leslie Inc.

There are a lot of parallels between LESL and Joanne:  Both are primarily legacy brick and mortar stores, serving an aging clientele, and both are (or were) extremely vulnerable to ecommerce and shifting consumer trends.  I could justify shorting the absolute shit out of LESL on its fundamentals alone.  Negative equity, bad loan terms, and no line of sight to enough profitability to get out from under it.  They're not even a realistic acquisition target due to their bylaws.  All of that is readily apparent in their annual report if you care to read it:  https://ir.lesliespool.com/sec-filings/all-sec-filings/content/0001193125-24-014254/0001193125-24-014254.pdf

Speaking of their annual report: They lay a lot of blame for their poor performance on inclement weather.  It's literally been the hottest year in history and they sell pool stuff.  Not buying it.

LESL went public in 2020 and, other than the initial honeymoon period, it's been a sustained loser since.  Their IPO made some funds a lot of money, but certainly didn't make them a better company.  Now, with no relief from high interest rates and debt covenants that could restrain them from raising new money, LESL is more vulnerable than ever.  

The vast majority of their existing equity is tied up in their inventories.  Not unusual but also not good news considering their house brands are overpriced and alternatives in the market place abound.  Based on my visits to a few of their stores, it seems like they're sustained mostly by: 1) boomers who haven't heard of youtube and cannot figure out how a pool works; and 2) literally nobody else. I defy you to find a house brand they sell that is price competitive with the market.

The next generation of pool owners isn't going to pay a 40% mark-up to buy from a chain pool place (not when amazon exists and home depot sells a similar product cheaper).  Ecommerce is coming for them in a big way and LESL's enormous geographic footprint will end up being an albatross around its neck.  They have 46 stores alone in the tropical paradise of Pennsylvania.  Good luck paying all that rent.

The best time to short LESL was three years ago, the second best time is now.  It's not HTB and short interest is relatively low considering how weak it is.  I am betting they're going to halve before the end of the year, more if more people pay attention to it.

The first map is meaningless. Everyone is going to hoard chicken, chicken nuggets and eggs but they're wasting their time.

When it comes to chicken, that industry can take a major hit, keep walking and laugh it off. The chicken and egg industry is impervious to issues. They have that shit on lock down.

When it comes to meat that you consume, it's down to ""egg to your plate"" in 28 days. If the birds weren't ""harvested"" at this point, their legs would snap under their own weight. They're fatter than ever but their bone structure hasn't changed to adapt to it.

When it comes to eggs, billions of chickens are laying them daily, at peak, every 16 hours. Eggs last forever, the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes, they grow faster than ever.

You can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.

# How do I know this?

3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.

The one that matters here is live chickens.

The highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.

Ever wonder what $8,200,000 worth of chickens look like?

Feast your eyes on this:

&#x200B;

8,200 chickens worth $1,000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn, 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them, I was escorted down the highway, blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16,500,000 worth of chickens, 4,500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.

(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist, supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)

These are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.

I've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10,000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather, it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there, they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).

# There won't be a shortage of chicken, meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.

&#x200B;

Let's discuss beef for a second.

Beef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also, of all the mafia ridden shit going, beef is definitely it.

There are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.

\- feminine hygiene products

\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)

\- frozen meat

&#x200B;

If they did, you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint, or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.

On the other hand, it's abundant. 

Being Canadian, we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;

\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022, Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))

\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada‚Äôs beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)

There is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef, 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.

Final point:

Who is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  
Brazil  
**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023, followed by India, which exports water buffalo, the United States and Australia. Mar 5, 2024

# This is also not the play.

&#x200B;

Ok, so what is the play?

# MILK

&#x200B;

This shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.

You can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. 

The substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.

\- school milk programs

\- cheese production

\- butter

\- ice cream

\- yogurt

&#x200B;

You might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.

This is where you're wrong.

""In the barn"" means ""in the workers"".

The industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. 

Let's visualize that journey:

\- It starts at the feed mill.

\- Then it's a truck driver.

\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.

\- Another driver who collects the milk.

\- A dock worker.

\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.

\- Another truck driver.

\- The person stocking the shelves.

&#x200B;

Whether you realize it or not, that's 50+ people.

Thinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.

If a cow gets sick, they produce way less milk.

The following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while, she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse, the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.

[The last time this happened, they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)

&#x200B;

This should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.

&#x200B;

# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.

&#x200B;

Also... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?

822,VST the Texas Energy Company just keeps defying gravity,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,10,10,09-04-2024 17:49:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzye8m/vst_the_texas_energy_company_just_keeps_defying/,"**Vistra Corp (VST)**

I think it took a real rise because of the [WSJ article](https://archive.ph/A5WHE) back at the end of March about VST being an AI stock and this thing looks more like NVDA every day. I call it my poor man's NVDA. Maybe my fellow smooth brains might see it too? This Texas based integrated retail electricity and power generation company is just on a tear this year. It has a focus on low and no carbon emission generation. They are pushing the boundaries towards a sustainable future; not just doubling down on fossil fuels while green washing with a dabbling in renewables. Even though this has increased from $38 to $70 as of this writing, I still think it's a sleeper hit in your investment portfolio, especially with the AI boom printing money. AI data centers need energy like they need NVDA chips. All part of the shovels to gold miners metaphor. 

**Fundamentals Highlights:**

**Market Potential:**

* **Stock Performance:** Vistra's stock has already seen an impressive 85% increase year to date, attributed in part to the AI-driven demand for electricity‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.
* **Power Demand Tailwinds:** Companies that are net long power, like Vistra, stand to gain as power demand escalates‚Äã ([Yahoo Finance](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/vistra-corp-vst-announces-strong-123237528.html))‚Äã.

**Risks and Considerations:** Undeniable growth doesn't mean undeniable rise in stock price. This is not financial advice and I have a bias to make this more popular. 

**Technical Analysis:** For what it's worth, the basic technicals are showing a slight pause and reversal to the 50 day SMA but still quite a bit above it. It's currently right in the middle of a Keltner channel but not below it enough to use the scalping tactic. So for any day trading or swing trading approach, I'd say just watch it for a better opening. Since this acts more like NVDA, then maybe waiting to jump in is just going to make it more expensive for you. 

**Conclusion:** Vistra Corp (VST) presents a compelling investment opportunity, especially for those looking to leverage the burgeoning demand for electricity driven by the AI boom. With solid financials, strategic growth initiatives, and a strong foothold in clean energy, Vistra is not just navigating the transition to a zero-carbon future; it's leading the charge. As the energy sector becomes increasingly critical in the AI era, Vistra's unique position could make it a standout choice for investors seeking growth and sustainability.

Vistra offers a blend of innovation, sustainability, and financial savvy that could pay dividends in the AI-driven future.

*My bias: I hold stock and have long call positions. I am long on 165 contracts @ $1 for 4/19 exp $75 calls which has a realistic possibility of the underlying going to $80 by expiration and being worth $66K profit. So, yeah I'd love nothing more than to see this rise. Today took a negative swing that might be a good opening as I opened 75% of my current position this morning as it took a major dump.* "
823,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",wallstreetbets,Lowe's,283,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Too tired to write more...

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

1200 Jan 2026 calls from $20-$25

I would be happy with 1%-2% increase a week in the stock, we have 9-21 months for the LEAPs"
824,"Leaps on $ET, Potential 10 bagger as Oil Surges (DD)",wallstreetbets,Lowe's,205,114,08-04-2024 22:45:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzbzd3/leaps_on_et_potential_10_bagger_as_oil_surges_dd/,"**Leaps on $ET are dirt cheap right now.**

We have seen oil really ramping up in the past week and has gone up 10% in the past month. Tickers such as $PAA have seen big gains this week, especially the leap options that were trading at super low premiums. $PAA 1/17/25 20c was trading at $0.15 less than two weeks ago and is now trading at $1.25, an 8 bagger for those who got in at the premium. I expect to see this momentum continue as oil prices surge. 

Now, there is another potential 10 bagger waiting for its chance to shine while the oil sector becomes crowded. $ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in the united states, which transports oil and natural gas. It is the second biggest midstream company with a market cap of 53B. So far this year $ET has gone up 26%, and has beat earnings 3 out of the last 4 quarters. It has also increased distribution in every quarter since the start of 2022, with its quarterly distribution of 31.5 cents being higher than it was before they cut distribution back during covid. 

$ET will greatly benefit due to this increased demand in oil. The IEA raised its estimate in March for 2024 oil demand from 110,000 b/d (barrels per day) to 1.3 million b/d. Due to the Russian oil sanctions and other political issues driving oil and gas prices, the US has become the largest oil producer in the world and will continue to be. 

The premiums on $ET leaps are still super low right now. 1/17/25 20c is sitting at a pretty $0.12 per contract. 1/16/26 20c and 22c are sitting at $0.30 and $0.17 respectively. Again, just so much upside to this play. With $PAA leaps already taking off, others such as $ET & $EPD will follow with this surge in oil during 2024. The upside for short term and long term profits are substantial. Also would like to thank /u/PuzzleheadedTear5969 for his DD on $PAA and inspiring me to look more into this sector. His DD has more information of the political climate sparking this surge in oil.

I'm in for 120 contracts at $0.12 for 1/17/25. Considering adding 1/26 leaps as well tomorrow.

825,4/10 Will be a good day for $TSM,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,323,256,06-04-2024 23:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfb6/410_will_be_a_good_day_for_tsm/,"**EDIT: added a hindsight report the morning of 4/10. Find it at the bottom of the text wall**

**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

EDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns

EDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of

Hindsight Report, added the morning of 4/10 pre-market:

TSMC‚Äôs revenue report came in at 195k, a whopping 34% YoY increase from March of 2023, and a mere 8k short of my low-end prediction; however, the stock spiked very high just before the report was released, then fell off pretty quick shortly after the report was released, I imagine it experienced a little bit of a pump-and-dump over in the Taiwan market. This is most likely due to the report coming out after close in Taiwan. CPI came it at 0.1% over estimate and there was a big overreaction in pretty much every sector. Since this is such a small gap, I don‚Äôt think the dip will last long, and I am still bullish for earnings.

 While everyone is waiting for FED to cut rates, I'm seeing it otherwise. Forget cuts, we might be looking at rate hikes later this year. Rising commodity prices are going to bring back scorching inflation. 

  
**Common myth:** Interest rates control commodity prices  

**Reality**: Commodity prices govern interest rates. Central banks are just data observers and just follow what the commodity prices and hence inflation tells them. What if the inflation still keeps rising? They just follow.

And I understand that consumer demand is low.

827,Best ways to give yourself odds,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,113,115,06-04-2024 13:41:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxbvb0/best_ways_to_give_yourself_odds/,"It's very common for people to call day traders ""gamblers"", to conflate the world of trading FDs and small caps with the world of slot machines and rigged table games. 

It only reinforces this view when a trader treats the market like a casino. For instance, the odds of winning any given hand of blackjack are approximately 49% at most casinos (depending on the rules, how many decks of cards, or whether you can speak an exotic foreign language to the dealer). 

So, if walking into a casino with the goal of making a bet with your money and walk out richer a gambler wants to make a single bet, place all the money they brought to gamble with them on one hand BECAUSE THE ODDS ARE LESS THAN 50%. The more hands a gambler plays, the more likely they are to walk out with financial losses (bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49 + bet *.49... = CONGRATULATIONS, YOU'RE DRUNK AS SHIT AND YOUR MONEY IS ALL GONE!). 

The stock market game can be different. There are simple systems of trading and various setups in technicals that can give the trader an edge GREATER THAN 50%, therefore a successful trader will play to stay in the game and make as many bets on setups that give them the odds as possible. So, instead of opening Robinhood and posting all of one's money on a single bet, it makes more sense to let one's self budget for the expense of losing trades. 

Say a strategy gives 7 wins for 3 losses on average (arbitrary), then on one's balance they could say they'll risk no more than 5% on any given trade (again, arbitrary and erring towards aggression because we tend to try to get rich quick here). A trader would likely never have such excessive drawdown in their account that they'd be out of the game, and moreso as the percent of risk per their account shrinks. 

For instance, I've noticed if the market opens at support or resistance it will usually be really good odds to buy a call or put for the corresponding scenario, especially because the opening tends to come with a burst of volume and momentum, which can give strong odds for profits on 0dtes >50% within minutes. 

Sometimes the market doesn't open at support or resistance. What then? Well, the pre-market often can give a trader a few clues on what levels the market may gravitate towards that day. Say the market opens and it does its thing, usually a little tug-a-war, then one side gains the upper hand and there's a burst in price in either direction. A trader can often hop into this momentum and target a pre-market high or low. 

What about when a stock reaches its resistance or support? Should a trader immediately reverse course and buy a put or call? Not necessarily. Most often there is a battle at these levels that can result in a stock trading sideways for awhile. It would grind away theta on 0dtes and weeklies quickly, and even worse, totally smash their value if the price were to break out and run again the trade. So it's best to wait for something that gives odds like a decisive move past the level (usually including a retest of the level then a move past the prior breaking move), or a double bottom/top (preferably with false break suggesting a large player seeking liquidity at levels with lots of open orders).

Of course none of the three aforementioned strategies have a 100% success rate. Market bots are designed to beat retail traders by tricking them and playing on their emotional tendencies. They're very good at it. So a successful trader has to be nimble minded and prepared for anything. 

Just a few thoughts and some of my favorite setups. If you disagree and believe it's best to throw down every bit of money you can access on a single play, I find nothing particularly wrong with that. I find it ballsy and entertaining. 

Trading in a systemic and analytic manner is much tougher to execute and few people actually succeed. Those who do usually lose a lot of money before gaining the skillset required to be consistent. I still have a lot of improving to do personally but I do believe I can do it because some other people can and I've had several month long streaks of success. 

It's just a matter of a single day or two where I become emotional after a loss that balloons to the size of Texas (relative to my account) that has kept me from being able to quit my job. I've adopted a strategy of withdrawing gains from my cash account and keeping the balance only large enough to make decent income, but small enough that I likely won't get emotional about it and that any horrible day won't have me begging on a street corner. 

Anyways, to those who read this far -- toodles! And good luck! üëç Share your personal favorite strategy/setup that works best for you if you will. "

829,RH and BLK and coming earnings and why I shorted RH ?! What about BLK?,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,11,27,06-04-2024 01:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwzo8y/rh_and_blk_and_coming_earnings_and_why_i_shorted/,"Let's see if I can summarize this here. I have been short on RH for some time now. Before making my conclusions, I examined the following data. First off, I want to say that my research led me to believe that the product's quality is not that great. I live in NYC, and RH has an outlet here in Industry City, which is in Sunset Park, Brooklyn. Their prices are overextended, which I attribute to RH's thorough research. They know that the average household income of families residing in the surrounding areas exceeds $250k per year. I am pretty sure their outlets are in similar locations for the exact same reason: it's a simple profit/loss ratio, and RH knows that the higher profit margin will offset the higher average carrying expenses. So, why would I short the stock and bet against RH? My first reason was the low home sales. Interest rates have risen quite a bit; a 30-year fixed rate is above 7%, and most homebuyers would try to maximize their savings by purchasing furniture from one of RH's competitors. RH supposedly manufactures their furniture pieces in China. Full disclosure, I have no idea where exactly it is made, but a simple Google search will tell you that. Follow this link for more information: \[link to furniture manufacturing details\].

Have consumers been complaining about the product or the quality of the product? You can read the reviews for yourself here: \[link to consumer reviews\].

Now, my reasoning was that since home sales have been down, and the quality of the furniture is not pleasing to the average consumer, and in general, people are not furnishing their new houses, RH would likely miss their analysts' earnings call and underperform. Well, this is exactly what happened. The adjusted net revenue of $738 million missed the consensus mark of $777 million by 5% and fell by 4.4% on a year-over-year basis. The revenue decline was attributed to ""several weather"" events in January and shipping delays related to the ongoing conflict in the Red Sea. RH missed Q4 earnings and revenue estimates. RH reported quarterly earnings of $0.71 per share, missing the estimated earnings of $1.71 per share.

Logically, one would expect that the price per share of the stock would drop accordingly to account for the revenue loss. However, we witnessed the opposite; the price per share went up by almost 18% after the earnings announcement.

Let's not forget that the short interest before the earnings call was more than 51%.

According to the data and common sense consensus, everyone should have expected that since RH did not meet expectations, the price per share would come down to adjust the value based on performance. This did not happen. On the contrary, the price went up, and shorts got squeezed.

Could this be manipulation? No way, this is a fair commodity, a self-regulated market, and manipulations are not possible.

Now, let's talk about the biggest institutional investors behind RH. It turns out that the largest shareholders include Vanguard Group and BlackRock Inc.

I am trying to find any correlation between the price movement of RH's stock and BLK's, but my indicators are not refined enough to discover the precise connection, and I would leave this to the readers.

Anyway, why am I talking about RH and a potential connection with market movement and the price of BLK's stock? Well, BLK is set to announce earnings this coming Friday, April 12th.

So, some scenarios could possibly aid the retail investor's decision. How overstretched are the big funds, and could they go down because their investment assets have come down in price? Let's not forget LULU... What are your bets? Are you playing calls or puts on BLK?

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "
831,Ymab Therapeutics Just Initiated a New Trial Yesterday for Non Hodgkin Lymphoma,wallstreetbets,Lowe's,9,12,05-04-2024 19:50:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwr95t/ymab_therapeutics_just_initiated_a_new_trial/,"The link to the trial is below:

[https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05994157?cond=Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin&aggFilters=status:not&rank=2](https://clinicaltrials.gov/study/NCT05994157?cond=Lymphoma,Non-Hodgkin&aggFilters=status:not&rank=2)

Planning for the trial started as early as August 2023. The trial plans to enroll approximately 30 people, but will enroll as few as 16 people based on the company's history. 

The drug they are proposing is a variant of Daratumumab, with delivery of the drug to the site of the tumor using special nano technology developed by Massachusetts Institute of Technology. 

One thing I noticed was that the exclusion criteria for the trial included '>40% lymphoma bone marrow involvement'. However, over 80% of small lymphocyte lymphoma cases involve bone marrow, especially with the younger age group (18-34 years) that the company will likely recruit from. 

[https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902](https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/abs/pii/S0889858809000902)

  
Of those 80%, more than half will have higher than 40% bone marrow involvement. Even though the 5-year survival period for the most aggressive cases of lymphoma is 60%, this trial will likely fail. This is because the exclusion criteria also mentions that a person cannot be on any maintenance treatment for at least 100 days prior to entering the trial. As a result, a person with recurrent, aggressive non Hodgkin's lymphoma without maintenance treatment will be poorly equipped to fight the disease. 

  
Ymab Therapeutics is running the bulk of it trials in Scottsdale Arizona, where numerous patients have reported their disease initially looking very similar to multiple myeloma, requiring multiple biopsies to confirm the correct disease. Multiple biopsies create the risk of a tumor spreading and becoming untreatable, even if the patient barely satisfies the trial's inclusion criteria. 

I believe that the trials will fail to demonstrate any meaningful improvement in the patient's condition despite the company's claim of the drug offering a low toxicity profile. 

  
If the company does not update its recruiting status by end of April, they are very likely not going to move forward with the trial based on initial results with treated patients.

1. Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.
2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.
3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption. This would create a rotation out of ICE cars and into EV's. This comes at a bad time as GM and Ford are scaling back EV production.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html)

I think things in the middle east will escalate so will things with Russia/NATO. This will push oil prices to very high levels and will lead to a EV rush. Tesla's inventory should shrink as prices are super low.  All commodities are going higher right now. No one wants to pay $10 per gallon of gas or $100+ for a fill up each week."

835,"In one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year, the S&P500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a few hours. Here's why.",wallstreetbets,Lowe's,3107,245,05-04-2024 02:10:28,https://i.redd.it/cx6fsc3kkksc1.png,"[Original](https://pro.thestreet.com/market-commentary/dramatic-shift-in-market-takes-everyone-by-surprise)

Thursday was supposed to be a quiet session as market participants awaited the very important March jobs report, which will be released Friday morning. Instead, it turned into one of the most chaotic market sessions of the year.

The day started with a gap-up open mainly due to chatter that there is weakness in the job market and that there is a good likelihood that the March jobs news may be softer than expected and trigger a Fed rate cut in June. It was a questionable premise, but it created a little squeeze action and some underlying support.

Later in the day, headlines hit that Fed member Kashkari commented that ‚Äúif inflation continues to move sideways, it makes me wonder if we should cut rates at all this year.‚Äù This isn‚Äôt the first hawkish comment from a Fed member, and it probably wouldn‚Äôt have had too much of an impact, but then some other more dramatic news hit.

In Tel Aviv, Israel, residents were confused when their GPS applications showed that they were located in Lebanon. The reason was that the Israeli military was scrambling GPS signals in preparation for a possible drone attack by Iran. Reports circulated that Israel sees indications that Iran may launch missile/drone attacks from Iranian territory, possibly on Friday. Israeli officials informed the U.S. that an Iranian attack would trigger a response.

This news caused oil to spike higher, defense contractors to rally, and the market to sell steadily into the close.

The S&P 500 went from a 52-week high to a 10-day low in a matter of a few hours. This has only happened four other times before, according to Jason Goepfert.

It was a dramatic shift and caught almost everyone by surprise. Sharp intraday reversals are often major turning points.

We still have the jobs news to deal with Friday morning, and we will see if there actually is an attack on Israel, but the market is now very unsettled. Volatility has spiked, and there should be a major shift in sentiment as a result of this action.

I‚Äôll have more in the morning prior to the jobs news, but that report now has the capacity to accelerate a correction that has been anticipated for several months.

Have a good evening. I‚Äôll see you Friday.

Edit: Kashkari started speaking at 2pm, when the markets were already crashing. Also, the US10Y did not shoot up but dropped instead.

The Hershey Company is known for their chocolate bars but they also sell many other snacks and candy using over 20 different brand names including Jolly Rancher, and Kit Kat. While they pride themselves as a smile spreading company that attempts to create tasty memories like roasting s'mores over a campfire, they do a lot of research and testing under the hood. They have a division dedicated to public perception and where their products will be best suited for sale. Michelle Buck, CEO of the company even states ""our retail partners transition to a storytelling role"" meaning they can sell more chocolate by engaging with the customer more.

By transitioning their marketing approach, they are now selling more than chocolate. They are turning chocolate into an emotion to latch onto and associate with their brand. On their website there is minimal mentions of the word chocolate. They are leaning into their name becoming an almost generic term for chocolate and are now focusing on making chocolate a necessary part of the general publics lives.

Based on my research, Hershey's could be a good investment. Their stock price is down right now as a result of supply chain issues, however to to their ubiquitous name, I don't think they are going anywhere as a company and will probably return to normal levels of growth after adjusting their business practices. They have also been increasing dividend percentages rapidly, almost doubling in the last year to ease the pain of a falling stock price. While many investors may see red as a sign of a company doing bad, in this case, it is an opportunity to invest in a company that has proven to have room for growth."

About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

845,NYCB Terrible Earnings,wallstreetbets,M&T Bank,2,12,01-05-2024 11:46:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chk4un/nycb_terrible_earnings/,"Earnings just released and it isn‚Äôt pretty. So recently to save the bank from failing shareholder got diluted 70%+ with more dilution on the horizon via warrants. That dilution itself would be sufficient explanation for its current price. Instead they posted an all time terrible 4q2023 earnings. 

Well 1q2024 is in and it‚Äôs bad. Excluding write downs losses accelerated from 187 million to 327 million q/q or a jump of 75%. I guess all of that dilution saves you so eps is only a loss of 45c share.  Worst of all that‚Äôs a loss of 45c per share after selling their best loans meaning losses next quarter are almost guaranteed to be worse. Net interest income down 16% q/q. Net interest margin down 54 basis points q/q (that‚Äôs a 20% NIM drop in a single quarter). 27% Revenue drop q/q and 76.2% drop y/y.   Non interest income went from 127M last quarter to 9M this quarter. Non performing loans jumped 86.5% q/q. Allowance for credit losses jumped 21% q/q.

Overall these are terrible numbers but to have this bad of a q/q results after an all time bad quarter is scary so they need to show those losses decelerating very soon otherwise anymore capital flight and they could go under. I don‚Äôt personally expect them to fail but if you have shares I‚Äôd use any low volume pre market pump to get out. This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze opportunity and they just proved the road to meeting even yesterday‚Äôs valuation is probably over 2 years away. Be wary I‚Äôve seen plenty of big pops on earnings before the market opens evaporate when real investors start selling at open.

Edit: One last thought. It to me feels shady that they really rushed this earnings (13 hour notice) into the morning of an fomc meeting. This is most likely because many regionals used the most rosy legally allowable prediction of two rate cuts in their 2024 forward looking statements and I‚Äôm sure Otting wanted to do the same instead of waiting a week or 2 and having to be only able to factor in one or zero. That‚Äôs a huge impact to net interest income. "

Oops, how did that dynamite get in there‚Ä¶? Well, for every potential rocket, there‚Äôs the chance it explodes in your face.

I‚Äôve worked in Big Tech and FinTech, and think SoFi has a good shot at differentiating their offerings in the FinTech sector and recognizing a higher valuation, as they grow their technology offerings. 

Specifically watching Galileo and Technisys. When you talk platforms and banking cores, it‚Äôs easy to lose people, but this is where the wonder of finance happens.

Outside of that, the continued cross selling of services will be important and lowered customer acquisition costs, which I think is doable.

849,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,M&T Bank,78,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

850,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Marathon Oil,38,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict.

852,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,43,33,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. 

Earnings Marathon
Full Port Every Time - This is a Million Dollar Week!

Week 1:
Tesla - Calls
Meta - Puts
Google- Calls

Week 2:
MSTR: Puts
SMCI & AMD: Puts
Carvana: Calls
Apple: Calls

Week 3:
Monday after close / Tuesday before open
Palantir, Disney: 

Tuesday after close / Wednesday before open
Arista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: 

Wednesday after close / Thursday before open
Arm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:

Thursday after close / Friday before open
Mara, Soundhound:

These are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.

My Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50.

**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

https://preview.redd.it/2t8w8lxqt3yc1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb83733453c9f2abaac5738615e35ea77939b3d

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology & data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let‚Äôs go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here‚Äôs the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, üêª open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won‚Äôt go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can‚Äôt make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

860,Apple - Regardless of this Quarter; Now is the time,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,46,113,27-04-2024 02:00:49,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ce31se/apple_regardless_of_this_quarter_now_is_the_time/,"Based on recent market activity I think this is a good entry point for Apple off the lows.

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now

* Fall in phone sales especially in China
* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year.
* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.
* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)
* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)
* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense

However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.

Install Base & Great Product recognition

Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.

Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?

AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.

~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~

Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)

The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. 

As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.

Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.

Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space.

861,IS ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL?,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,8,39,24-04-2024 20:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc982d/is_anyone_actually_bullish_about_ccl/,"Is anyone bullish about $CCL??? Honestly, take a look at the fundamentals, the bottom and top lines, and consider its potential for growth.

(Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = üöÄ potential.

Loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of 100+ ships.

Long-term play, potential 5x-10x return.)

I'm bullish about $CCL, and here's why:

First, let's take a look at the fundamentals. Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company, with a market cap of approximately $18.79 billion as of April 24, 2024. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78, indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity. Additionally, $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships, making it a major player in the cruise industry.

Now, let's consider the company's financial performance. In 2023, $CCL reported revenue of $24.5 billion, a significant increase from the $5.6 billion it reported in 2022. This indicates that the travel demand is surging, and $CCL is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

Moreover, $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4, compared to the industry average of 15. This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth.

The company's history also supports a bullish outlook. Before the pandemic, $CCL was a high-flying stock, with a P/E ratio of over 20. While the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, it has since recovered and is now back on track for growth.

Essentially, with a loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of over 100 ships, $CCL is a long-term play with the potential for a 5x-10x return. The surge in travel demand and the company's undervalued stock price make it an attractive investment opportunity."
862,TSLA: Big question for Elon today on earnings day!,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,470,309,23-04-2024 12:46:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cb3pqq/tsla_big_question_for_elon_today_on_earnings_day/,"IMO, the biggest question for Elon to answer during today‚Äôs earnings will be what is Tesla strategy to counter $20K BYD Chinese cars coming into US soon from Mexican factories?

BYD executives announced on Wednesday the automaker will begin selling its Dolphin Mini electric vehicle (EV) in Mexico at 358,800 pesos ($20,990). 

If Elon‚Äôs plan to compete with BYD is to ask the president to put 100% tariffs on BYD imports, that‚Äôs not a good working plan. As I understand, there‚Äôs a limit to tariffs and then it goes to WTO for arbitration. Another problem is China can retaliate with its own sanctions & tariffs!

I have been saying for a long time now, Tesla needs a CEO who can focus on the car, customers & shareholders instead of X, fighting with media and its main customers - the liberals who have almost completely abandoned Tesla. IMO, the way things are going Tesla may go down below $125 soon. Long term, I‚Äôm still optimistic on Tesla, unfortunately it has become one manchild dependent company with a spineless board.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

864,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,197,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

865,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,129,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

866,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,215,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

1) Last earnings were reported Feb 21, beating on revenue but losing more money (negative EPS) than expected.

2) Bitcoin? They stopped accepting Bitcoin in 2022. Bitcoin prices have fallen since March but not in such a straight line.

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

869,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,2233,434,15-04-2024 19:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4uddl/donald_trump_is_taking_his_of_djt_todays_resale/,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

870,What the hell is going on with Rivian?,wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,123,138,13-04-2024 16:46:26,https://i.redd.it/3h6fzlu40auc1.jpeg,"There's seemingly major buy pressure for a stock that is still artificially tanking.
Rivian hasn't been doing well as a company since interest rate increases & the price of EV's drastically falling due to competition within their own used car markets and consumer skepticism about large EV and truck mile ranges.

Large institutions owned almost 90% of RIVN since IPO and r holding the bag on major losses. To regain cost basis they have been shorting Rivian into the ground.

Even though it was almost entirely held by institutions during IPO, somehow with only a 12% decrease in institutional ownership (some of the only shareholders) this accounted for almost a 70% decrease in price.

While I can only add one image, more than half of the put volume is still out of the money by a lot, and short interest for this stock is thru the roof at an all time high. if the stock were to rally 10-20% it could put these institutions in a very tough spot & I just don't see the end goal here.

They have a signed contract with Amazon set to deliver 100k delivery vans and the ceo is clear that they will be in an overall positive profit margin by Q42024. They have more assets to liability.

Which leaves me to 1 conclusion. These shak' quant analysts r shorting this stock for coke money.

I already have $14.000 worth of 2.5 leaps expiring January of next year but I want to hear what you all think!"

A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       

We are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap‚Äôs are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.

If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

877,"Leaps on $ET, Potential 10 bagger as Oil Surges (DD)",wallstreetbets,McCormick & Company,203,114,08-04-2024 22:45:16,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzbzd3/leaps_on_et_potential_10_bagger_as_oil_surges_dd/,"**Leaps on $ET are dirt cheap right now.**

We have seen oil really ramping up in the past week and has gone up 10% in the past month. Tickers such as $PAA have seen big gains this week, especially the leap options that were trading at super low premiums. $PAA 1/17/25 20c was trading at $0.15 less than two weeks ago and is now trading at $1.25, an 8 bagger for those who got in at the premium. I expect to see this momentum continue as oil prices surge. 

Now, there is another potential 10 bagger waiting for its chance to shine while the oil sector becomes crowded. $ET is one of the largest and most diversified midstream energy companies in the united states, which transports oil and natural gas. It is the second biggest midstream company with a market cap of 53B. So far this year $ET has gone up 26%, and has beat earnings 3 out of the last 4 quarters. It has also increased distribution in every quarter since the start of 2022, with its quarterly distribution of 31.5 cents being higher than it was before they cut distribution back during covid. 

$ET will greatly benefit due to this increased demand in oil. The IEA raised its estimate in March for 2024 oil demand from 110,000 b/d (barrels per day) to 1.3 million b/d. Due to the Russian oil sanctions and other political issues driving oil and gas prices, the US has become the largest oil producer in the world and will continue to be. 

The premiums on $ET leaps are still super low right now. 1/17/25 20c is sitting at a pretty $0.12 per contract. 1/16/26 20c and 22c are sitting at $0.30 and $0.17 respectively. Again, just so much upside to this play. With $PAA leaps already taking off, others such as $ET & $EPD will follow with this surge in oil during 2024. The upside for short term and long term profits are substantial. Also would like to thank /u/PuzzleheadedTear5969 for his DD on $PAA and inspiring me to look more into this sector. His DD has more information of the political climate sparking this surge in oil.

I'm in for 120 contracts at $0.12 for 1/17/25. Considering adding 1/26 leaps as well tomorrow.

TL;DR Buy Novo Nordisk because it‚Äôs undervalued with huge forward looking potential.

Four main points:



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly
2. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses
3. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue
4. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Novo Nordisk has a great business model. Help people lose weight & live longer. And you need to stay on on their drugs to keep weight off (so you stay on it forever). And the longer people live, the longer they‚Äôll buy GLP-1 drugs, the more money Novo Nordisk makes. But who cares if you can‚Äôt make money? I‚Äôll tell you how degens



1. Novo Nordisk is undervalued relative to Eli Lilly

Novo Nordisk:



* Market cap: 436 B
* Net Sales Growth: +31%
   * Earnings Per Share Growth: +52%
   * Net Profit Growth: +51%
* 2023 Revenue: $33.7 billion
* Net Profit Margin: 36%

Eli Lilly:



* Market cap: 745 B
* Net sales growth: +20%
   * Earnings per share: -16%
   * Net profit Change: -16%
* 2023 Revenue: $34.1 billion
* Net Income Margin: 15.3%

Comparing Novo Nordisk to Eli Lilly (their closest competitor), you can see Eli Lilly has a much higher market cap with MUCH worse financials. Now, that doesn‚Äôt mean Eli Lilly is a bad business (pls don‚Äôt short). But it means that Novo Nordisk, in my opinion, is UNDERVALUED. All their financial metrics BLOW Eli Lilly‚Äôs out of the water.

Hell, Eli Lilly literally decreasd their net profits by 16% YoY whereas Novo Nordisk increased their net profits by 51% YoY.

The numbers speak for themselves.



1. Novo Nordisk is getting their existing drugs approved for more valuable uses

In their latest financial report, Novo Nordisk says an FDA decision for Wegovy to become the first ‚Äúapproved weight management medicine \[that\] has been shown to reduce the risk of heart attacks, strokes and cardiovascular death‚Äù is expected in 2024 (aka this year). And the FDA is doing a ‚Äúpriority review‚Äù.

Why is this a big deal?

Because according to the CDC, heart disease and stroke are literally the biggest disease and biggest economic opportunity.

That means Wegovy has now just opened itself up to the largest $$$ opportunity.



1. Novo Nordisk is supply constrained. This is a solvable issue

Demand is there. In fact, they literally say in their financial report they have to ration their drugs and prioritize certain populations.

The biggest bottleneck is manufacturing. Which is what they‚Äôre heavily investing in. Long term, if half the world is on these drugs, manufacturing and supply chain become a moat because getting drugs out the door at scale becomes the problem.

‚ÄúIf you produce it, they will come‚Äù



1. Novo Nordisk will hopefully get a pill drug approved (vs an injection), making it easier to consume

Today, you have to get a once a week injection. No one likes that.

But Novo Nordisk will (hopefully) solve that with a pill that you take.

Now if you‚Äôre too lazy to workout and get an injection, you can just get a pill delivered to your door and lose weight.

There are some risks. Like competition from Eli Lilly. But my opinion is the market is very unsaturated. All glp-1 companies can grow because there's still so many people who have never used a glp-1 drug. Many companies will win. A rising tide will lift all ships.

The other big risk factor is a bad side effect. But glp-1 drugs have been around for a while so while there is a risk, the research feels relatively de-risked.

So yeah, go all in on Novo Nordisk.

A fellow regard posted his DD on the company a year ago, and he was right on the money. I'm here to tell you that even after this insane run up, its still not too late to get on this ride.

Despite bearish sentiment since their recent earnings, the stock's performance is backed up with improving fundamentals. If the business improves, its stock price will improve. It's strange to see cases where it doesn't happen over time.

I'll go through most of the important information from their financial statements:

**Revenue TTM:** from 3.7b to 4.28b

**ROA TTM:** from 0.1 to 11.54

**ROIC TTM:** from 0.16 to 18.18

**ROE TTM:** from 0.37 to 37.93

**Gross Margin TTM:** from 52.97 to 59.67

**Operating Margin TTM:** from 2.44 to 11.23

**Net Margin TTM:** from 0.08 to 7.67

**Debt to Equity ratio TTM:** from 1.76 to 1.01

**Total assets:** from 2.71b to 2.94b

**Total liabilities:** from 2.01b to 1.92b

**Total debt:** from 1.22b to 1.05

**Net debt:** from 706.59m to 147.48m

The only thing that was somewhat negative was that EPS was beaten only by 5%, the smallest out of the last 4 quarters.

I think its also important to mention a crucial element of this stock and that is the reduction of 30% of their float. Over the course of the last 6 years, the float was reduced from 65m outstanding to 49m outstanding, yet the price movement didn't respond accordingly. Only once the business made a turnaround, the price finally started it's ascend. In fact, the float was increased in the current year from 49m to 51m.

Almost every single aspect of the company and financial health improved in the recent quarter, yet the market decided that because the EPS was beaten by just 5%, it means its the end of world.

Will we see the same returns over the coming year? probably not

But I think this is a case of the ""stock is up this much, its can't possibly go any higher"" fallacy

I'm long on this position, but im guessing around 50-60% upside in the near future

That's is all for now fellow regards!

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

885,DNUT is the NVDA of fast food,wallstreetbets,McDonald's,26,68,26-04-2024 22:59:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdz935/dnut_is_the_nvda_of_fast_food/,"Greetings brothers and sisters,

Are you about tired of week after week of losing your closest relatives' land and property making random bets in the stock market? How are those TSLA puts and META calls? I feel your pain, my friends, and since I've felt your and my pain I'm making this DD because I've realized a once in a decade opportunity is upon us. 

I wanna start out with a little back story. When I was in 3rd grade back many years ago, we would have this thing where everyone would bring a treat when it was their birthday. There was this one girl named Karly K (omitting last name for respect, she is now dead from diabetes and premature obesity). Anyways, Karly K and her family absolutely loved donuts. And every year she would have her mom bring the most delicious dish. It was Krispy Kreme donuts sliced in half, buttered, seared in a skillet, then they put a juicy hamburger patty on them. 

Karly K brought these to school every year until she graduated. Not only did she bring them to school, but her and her family were actually selling catering for this dish. It had become extremely popular in the region of Canada I lived in at the time. 

Karly's dad was a custodian at the school and her mother a full-time stay at home mom. They probably lived in the dumpiest home I'd ever seen when she was in 2nd grade. The roof was caved in and when it got cold the only blankets they had were made out of food stamp certificates and Wendy's coupons knitted together that had been passed down for many generations. 

When she graduated this family was probably the richest people in Canada besides Drake. They had a swimming pool, chandeliers all over the place, and Lamborghinis. 

Now, it doesn't take a genius to realize this money was made by their catering business. And that brings me to my main point I want to make today -- DNUT closed the week with a sly 2.16B valuation. McDonald's has about a 200B valuation for comparison. 

Just a few weeks ago these two announced that Krispy Kreme donuts would be sold in pretty much every McDonald's in the US, probably a lot of the global market too, by 2026. 

So do the math with me, guys. If DNUT gets the footprint of a company about 100x bigger than them, does this add value? Yet, today DNUT is just a little bit above where it was before this incredible deal was announced. 

This means to me, that DNUT can probably grow revenue about as fast as NVDA did in the last two years in the next couple years. Possibly even faster. Donuts cost almost nothing to make and people will take out installment loans to buy them, so there's a lot of pricing power and margin in this business that can be exploited AFTER these donuts make their way into these McDonalds restaurants. So conservatively say their revenues and profits expand about 75x in the next 3 years, does this only justify a mere valuation of 1% of McDonald's? Nay!

Indeed, I highly suspect DNUT is worth closer to $150 a share today just on the outlook. And when the macro gets better and interest comes down and stuff, more people will use their credit cards to buy donuts with hamburgers in them at McDonald's. They will command about a 120-150 billion dollar valuation in 2-3 years. This would equate to a share price of about  $700 from today's $13. 

This is why I will be full porting my current Robinhood account and additional money I generate behind the Wendy's dumpster into DNUT stock and long dated call options. A 10,000 dollar investment will be worth like 600k in a couple years if everything works out as I've calculated. 

I've made my decision,  but what do you guys think? D-do or D-not, DNUT?"
886,BoomerDD - McFlation - watch this dividend giving stock to read the future of the market!,wallstreetbets,McDonald's,8,7,25-04-2024 03:14:18,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ccho7x/boomerdd_mcflation_watch_this_dividend_giving/,"McDonalds üçü earnings are coming of April 30th and that's BIG news for our Casino üé∞

  
In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "

I myself, took a beating betting against the Musktards, but prefer McDonalds... just a question of taste tbh.

..but this post is slightly different.

1. 10y yields broke 4,50, yet we moved the pain bar to 4,75... Nearly there, but 5% will truly be the apocalyptic yield, until the goal post gets moved to 5,50... Etc. Mkt doesn't give a shit about yields ATM.
2. Inflation is being shrugged off too as we witness record inflows...
3. Hubris in the air and everyone BTFD.
4. the economy is a disaster
5. Which leaves us with geo-political risk. Iran has a tasty plan for the bearish tards, and if your put margins are well covered, and you have enough time on your contracts (at least few weeks) I believe we're going to get some juicy fireworks a la Guy Fawkes soon. Here's my reasoning:

While the world celebrates that Iran and Israel have calmed down, we must remember war strategy, the art of war, and how real war games work. If you wish to have a successful offence: A) the element of surprise is key. B) never reveal dates or timing of an attack

Iran will not announce a real counter-attack and will play this down as much as possible. IDF has since, remobilised troops to Rafah, leaving the North vulnerable. Iran clearly stated that a counter-attack by Israel will not go unanswered and we know that ""the best future defence is a good offence"". Iran will launch a massive attack soon, either by proxy or together with their proxies and when this happens, bulls will be spraying diarrea like scatter guns and Wendy's HR will collapse with bullish tards trying to get burger-flipping internships.

So fellow bears üêª üêª, clutch those puts as if they were your imaginary trans wife's balls, and hang on for the ride.

888,NVO play,wallstreetbets,McDonald's,40,33,20-04-2024 19:20:42,https://i.redd.it/sgethib1qovc1.jpeg,"By now pretty much everyone has heard of NVO and Ozempic but the stock is trading no where near the levels of Al and chip stocks. Those stocks boomed on the hype yet now we are seeing big pullbacks. Now bears are saying it was just a bubble. Those types of stocks run until bears take over. Not saying they are bad but as markets fall they do too. You know what doesn't fall though, obesity rates. The graph shows the increasing obesity rates.

Obesity rates aren't just gaining because people eat unhealthy, but big companies encourage this to make money. We saw McDonald's and Krispy Kream partner up which will pretty much gaurenteed make them unreadable amounts of profit.

Now you may think to invest in those companies, but I find way more upside in the cure. Big companies will keep promoting obesity and as the rates rise, many will use ozempic. Increasing population and encouragement for obesity will keep rates rising while people use ozempic, resulting in more and more use of it.

Anyways, they have earnings coming up which I'm extremely bullish on. Not only that, but they are in a wedge pattern right now going into earning. My plays are as follows: 5/3 130$ calls, 5/3 135$ calls. Also have some stock. What do you guys think?"

Although Tesla once had the same problem.  At a $8.6B market cap, this company is worth a flyer.  Don‚Äôt make it more than 1% of your portfolio, but I think it‚Äôs worth a flyer at these depressed prices.  Amazon already has a 16.6% stake in Rivian and a 100K EV order, so don‚Äôt be surprised if Amazon acquires the $8.6B company and the stock price jumps 40% in one day (Definitely don‚Äôt short this stock).  

TSLA

Honestly I‚Äôm ecstatic at how dumb the price action is on this stock and that I‚Äôve had opportunities to keep buying more at lower prices.  If you sell a stock because it's going down, you're not an investor.  You're a moron.  The market has reacted very negatively from the shift away from a low-cost car to the robotaxi.  In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Good day fellow degenerates!

Some of you asked me to post an updated photo of my INTC position, but before, a few words. Since my DD, Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed, selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise, surprise, tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again, -8%, lol. Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3% the next day. 

Now, does all of this make sense? In some sense of course, the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years, which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor, Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary, I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor, Ryzen 9. No surprise, Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS, with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using, amongst others, the 20A process, meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process, resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT, GOOG, META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack, getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell, but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs, while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So, you may call me a degenerate idiot, I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However, no time pressure with shares, which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued, literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

914,Meta Platforms announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support AI generative artificial intelligence products and services,wallstreetbets,Meta Platforms,5,16,10-04-2024 16:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pyy6/meta_platforms_announced_its_latest_custommade/,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support generative artificial intelligence products and services on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

916,Entain Stock Primed for Growth,wallstreetbets,MGM Resorts,0,3,04-04-2024 12:05:25,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvlf8l/entain_stock_primed_for_growth/,"Dear Forum Members,

Today, I want to highlight the compelling case for investing in Entain stock (LSE: ENT) and why it holds significant potential for substantial growth in the near future.

Entain‚Äôs presence in the European market is poised to receive a significant boost this year, thanks to two major sporting events: the UEFA European Football Championship and the Olympic Games. These events command massive attention across Europe, translating into a surge in sports betting activity. Entain, with its substantial market share in Europe, is well-positioned to capitalize on this increased demand for betting services. With sports events gradually returning to their regular schedule, we can anticipate a surge in revenue for Entain, as it leverages its stronghold in the sports betting sector.

Moreover, let‚Äôs delve into the low price-to-earnings ratio (P/E ratio) of Entain, which stands at just 12.62 for 2025, according to Finanzen.net. This suggests that the stock is currently undervalued relative to its earnings, making it an attractive investment opportunity. As investors, this presents an opportunity to acquire Entain shares at a relatively low valuation, with the potential for significant upside as the company continues to grow its revenue and profitability.

Another aspect worth considering is the growth potential of Entain‚Äôs subsidiary, BetMGM, in the burgeoning U.S. sports betting market. With the gradual liberalization of sports betting regulations across various states in the U.S., BetMGM stands to benefit significantly. The company has been making strategic investments and partnerships to strengthen its position in this lucrative market, positioning itself as a key player poised for substantial growth in the coming years. In February BetMGM signed an exclusive Betting Partnership with X, which will lead to further growth in the US in near-term. 

Furthermore, there's speculation surrounding a potential reacquisition of Entain by MGM Resorts International, driven by the current low stock price of Entain. This lower valuation might prompt Entain to consider strategic options to create value for its shareholders. One such option could involve selling its 50% stake in BetMGM, as Entain might feel pressured to enhance shareholder value amidst the low stock price. This scenario adds an intriguing dimension to Entain's stock outlook, as it navigates the possibility of strategic moves to unlock shareholder value amidst changing market dynamics. While these possibilities remain speculative, they underscore the importance of monitoring Entain's strategic decisions in light of its current valuation and market conditions.

In conclusion, Entain‚Äôs stock presents a compelling investment opportunity, supported by factors such as its strong position in the European market, low price-to-earnings ratio, growth prospects in the U.S. through BetMGM, and the possibility of a strategic acquisition by MGM Resorts International.

I welcome your thoughts and further discussion on this investment opportunity."

922,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,Microsoft,267,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."

This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

Here are all the reasons why not to like Apple right now

* Fall in phone sales especially in China
* They have been absolutely sideways for the past 12 months and down \~9% for the year.
* Things are going to look bad for this quarter that's a given.
* Apple Vision is not selling well (give that thing a controller and games my god)
* Regulators are breathing down their neck (I do feel some of it is justified regardless of what Cramer says)
* It's been absent in this AI bonanza - probably their worst offense

However, with all of that said there is one thing that Apple has in its perpetual back pocket.

Install Base & Great Product recognition

Before I get into 2 companies that Apple will absolutely trounce, I want to talk about a prediction that is coming for their upcoming June developer conference.

Apple will 1000% announce their AI strategy. It is a foregone conclusion they will do this and in a meaningful way. If they don't do this it would be corporate malfeasance and Tim Cook should resign immediately. But why?

AI is something that YOU MUST get out the door and have people using it. It's not web search where you can make a deal with Google to use their AI offering. And BTW if you think that deal is going to happen with Google it 1000% is not. Apple would insane to do that. You have get your models up, trained and running. If you don't they can never improve. They can't get more training data. And, Apple is already reporting that they have models that are performing well.

~~To pay Google or anyone for Models when Meta is just releasing models for free right now is a non-starter. Apple will make their own AI models.~~

Apparently not. Apple is now talking to OpenAI too. So Apple using Microsoft. lol hmmm. Interesting.

[https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-26/apple-intensifies-talks-with-openai-for-iphone-generative-ai-features?embedded-checkout=true)

The fact that Apple isn't even look to compete with their own models is just wild to me. 

As much as I wish Microsoft and or OpenAI would do a hardware device (regarding AI), Apple has the install base to do something meaningful and in a big way with consumers. Literally, this can be another vertical for Apple.

Other hardware, such as ""The PIN"" and ""the Rabbit"" are horrible devices. The Rabbit is OK but it is beyond obvious that your phone is going to be able to do what those devices do shortly. Literally, all Apple has to do is look at anything worthwhile on those devices, what's not worthwhile on them and come out with a future Iphone that does all that and more. It will be like taking candy from a baby.

Edge AI, in my opinion is going to be a great game changer and very practical use case for what profitable AI will look like. Whether it's a Robot or your HER / hand-held device edge AI is where this all goes.

Samsung has already begun AI on the phone and I don't really use it because of 1 reason. It's not a great foundational model like OpenAI's ChatGPT or anything good that is native on the phone. And this is the beautiful thing about Apple. If Apple can just be good enough with their AI models - They're opportunity is different than any other player in the mobile space. They can put a model that they make directly on the phone. True Edge AI. Nobody else has the opportunity to do that in the way Apple does. This will make the AI faster, more responsive, great computer vision, audio capabilities will all be native on the phone.

All for $20 / $30 a month that Apple sheep will be happy to pay for.

Look for Apple to begin that story this June.

My position: Currently I have 1 share but I think now is the time."

937,Your Thoughts on $CLS Celestica,wallstreetbets,Microsoft,11,15,23-04-2024 15:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cb7owb/your_thoughts_on_cls_celestica/,"Earnings on 4/24/2024. I hold stock and debating whether to pick up a call or two. Here are some bullish thoughts from my broker's research department:

Bottom Line: 
We remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1/24 results‚Äîas we believe that CLS will continue to benefit, both in the near-term and longer-term, from the large AI-driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers. We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity, nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative.

Key Points
We anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise. Consensus Q1/24 estimates call for revenue of $2.1b and adj. EPS of $0.72, while FY2024 consensus is at $8.78b for revenue and $2.93 for adj. EPS. Current FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of >$8.5b and adj. EPS of $2.70; however we believe it's clear that this is too conservative‚Äîgiven subsequent capex guidance from key customers, which suggests that demand is accelerating. Our expectation is that FY2024 guidance will be raised to a level that's similar to, although perhaps not above, current consensus.

We're unclear on where buyside consensus might stand, but in our view, the stock's current valuation and significant pullback from its recent peak suggest that a sizable beat isn't currently being priced in.

Proprietary silicon servers, and 800G, should drive ongoing share gains. We believe that CLS has stronger competitive differentiation with respect to AI servers that are based on proprietary silicon vs. NVIDIA. Large hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft appear likely to shift a growing proportion of their server spend towards the former vs. the latter, and we expect that CLS should benefit from this dynamic. Additionally, CLS has been awarded 800G design wins from some of its hyperscaler customers, which are slated to ramp later this year and into FY2025.

While competition is a key risk (particularly given CLS's customer concentration), we believe that this is mitigated by the aforementioned factors, and the fact that Street estimates are only assuming single-digit revenue growth in FY2025 despite strong demand tailwinds. Further, the Street isn't forecasting much in the way of margin expansion next year, and we believe this may also represent a source of incremental upside.

We've raised our target price to US$48, reflecting 15x CY2025E adj. P/E and 8.8x EV/EBITDA.

Our Thesis
We rate Celestica shares Outperform. We believe the stock's historical valuation discount to peers should continue to narrow given its revenue and margin trajectory, the significant improvements that CLS has made to its revenue mix in recent years, and its AI exposure.

Valuation
Our US$48 target price is based on a CY2025E adj. P/E multiple of 15x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.8x. We believe this is appropriate in the context of CLS's peer group given its relative size, growth profile and revenue mix.

Upside Scenario
$55.00
Our upside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate increases by 7%, perhaps driven by a stronger recovery in semi equipment and better-than-expected hyperscaler demand, and the stock's multiple expands to 16x adj. P/E.

Downside Scenario
$34.00
Our downside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate decreases by 7%, perhaps due to a softer demand backdrop, and the stock's multiple contracts to 11.5x adj. P/E."

""Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff.

I don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the ""chips"".

[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)

Nvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture.

The point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players.

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.

>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year.""¬†

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.

Matter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.

In the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It‚Äôll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.

Companies use it mostly to offer a bad Customer Support experience to their users, like they did with those awful chatbots a few years ago.

So, Nvidia sold a lot of chips, OpenAI and Microsoft sold a lot of subscriptions, and that's pretty much it.   
  
There aren't many other companies actually making money from AI, since there aren't real use cases where it's actually useful in a B2B case. 

OpenAI did a great job of promoting Gen AI as being the magical solution, we've all seen the article claiming that AI paid a human on Taskrabbit to solve a reCAPTCHA, but that never actually happened.

And Sam Altman tried so hard to make everyone believe that AI is so powerful and that he's worried it will take over the world, insisting that it should be regulated or we'll all die.

I believe AMD will underperform the market which has room to run, but there are better players. 

AMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation ""something"" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

PS - based on comments a lot of folks lost money in AMD today and I am sorry about that.  Take my advice and don't lose the rest as it declines further from here. It has another 15-20% to go."

This is a post regarding AMD's call.

Revenue in Q1 slightly beat expectations... so did EPS. Margins are getting better. All good execution.   

The guidance is decent, considering there are some **BAD** moving parts which I'll cover below.   

I'll share the Good, Bad & Ugly starting backwards...   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **UGLY**: **GAMING** 

Gaming got killed in Q1 and will continue hurting. Why?   

* PS5 pro preparing to launch this year (so consumers hold purchases).   
* Gaming GPUs sell less due to new gaming architectures launching this year, with RDNA4 being teased in Computex in 5 weeks.     
 

**This explains why gaming dropped by 48% (and will continue dropping in Q2).**

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* The Sony PS5 PRO will sell strong at launch... and will likely be hard to buy (as usual).   
* RDNA4 will sell STRONG, as AMD will only target the mid-range (no high-end this gen).   
* Gaming has low margins.

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **BAD**: Supply constraints impacting MI300   

During minute 38 of the call (probably the most important item  discussed), while answering Vivek Arya's question (Bank of America), Dr.  Lisa Su explained that MI300 has more demand than supply also for Q2.  In essence, AMD can't sell enough due to supply constrains. AMD expects  supply to improve in the back half of the year, which is why they **raised the guidance** for over $4bn sales (up from $3.5bn).   

**However, this is NOT a reason to be concerned, because:** 

* Demand exceeding supply means that the MI300 series is COMPETITIVE.   
* As supply improves, so will sales... explaining why MI300 is doing **STRONG**.   
* Supply will catch-up with demand in 2024, making it possible to exceed the ""over $4bn"" figure.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

The **GOOD: Data center GPUs, CPUs and MARGINS** 

The most profitable and KEY products are selling **STRONG**.   

MI300 is a success... and the ONLY reason why AMD didn't sell more  was due to supply constraints. Also, Turin is sampling and the Data  Center segment remains STRONG.   

Growth of 80% year over year is impressive... with **STRONG** double digit growth for 2024 guided.   

\------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

**Conclusion:** 

AMD is supply constrained on MI300 products... but they were still  able to compensate the gaming segment (dropping 48%) and also embedded  (dropping 46%).   

It is likely that  $227 is a ceiling that will take many months to break.   

Also, today was a **BAD** day for markets, marking the close of the worst month of 2024.   

However, guidance for MI300 sales is 2024 is up... to ""over $4bn"" (from $3.5bn).   

I would've wanted to hear $5bn, but I'll likely have to wait until the Q2 ER, as supply improves.   

The stock will likely bleed tomorrow, but the core of AMD's thesis is still **STRONG**."

952,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Monolithic Power Systems,202,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

953,Meta Platforms announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support AI generative artificial intelligence products and services,wallstreetbets,Monolithic Power Systems,3,16,10-04-2024 16:36:46,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0pyy6/meta_platforms_announced_its_latest_custommade/,"Meta Platforms (NASDAQ:META) announced its latest custom-made chips designed to support generative artificial intelligence products and services on Wednesday.

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Will the ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù Exit Impact Apple Stock.

Why Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.

Apple Watch X: The latest on Apple‚Äôs plans for a major design refresh
April 24,2024

https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/24/apple-watch-x-design-overhaul/



Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple."
955,Are We Approaching the Breaking Point for Stock Valuations and Interest Rates?,wallstreetbets,Morgan Stanley,14,9,19-04-2024 01:00:34,https://i.redd.it/5zcvwtju4cvc1.jpeg,"Stocks have been on a tear since last October, with valuations (price-to-earnings ratios) soaring from around 20x to 25x (the blue line in the chart). This surge in stock valuations coincided with a sharp drop in interest rates, with the 10-year Treasury yield plunging from 5% to below 4% in just a few months (the white line, using the inverted scale on the right).

It makes sense that lower rates would boost valuations, as they increase the present value of future earnings. However, here's where things get interesting: even as rates started climbing again earlier this year, valuations continued to creep higher instead of reversing course as you might expect.

So what gives? Well, the economy has shown surprising resilience despite the higher rate environment. This has allowed investors to focus on positive factors like the strength of the US consumer and the potential for AI-driven earnings growth, essentially shrugging off the headwinds from elevated interest rates.

But this disconnect between rates and valuations might not last forever. Morgan Stanley warns that there's a breaking point around the 4.35% level on the 10-year Treasury yield, where higher rates could really start to weigh on valuations and stock prices. Lo and behold, we just crossed that threshold.
If rates continue to march higher, investors may start to factor this into their valuation models, bringing those lofty multiples back down to earth. 

This could spell trouble not just for riskier, rate-sensitive segments of the market like small-caps and value stocks (which tend to have higher financing costs and more leveraged balance sheets), but also for the market leaders if they fail to deliver on ambitious earnings expectations.

As we head into the thick of earnings season, it's crucial to monitor not just the headline results and management commentary, but also the trajectory of interest rates in the background. The stock market has been able to defy gravity in the face of rising rates so far - but that might not be the case for much longer. Don't be caught off guard if this crucial macro variable reasserts its influence with a vengeance."
956,DD on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here??,wallstreetbets,Morgan Stanley,16,5,18-04-2024 03:05:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6t21z/dd_on_zoetis_zts_risk_reward_looking_attractive/,"This is my first DD so please be gentleüòä

The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04/12:

[https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6)

Quote: ""The FDA received more than 3,800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year. The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12,300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7,700 for Solensia since 2021, when the drugs went on sale in Europe. The figures include reports from the U.S. and other countries outside of the European Union.""

But a 04/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: ""Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products. On recent concerns over Librela side effects,¬†*only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela, 83% have some level of concern but still prescribe, and 13% are not at all concerned.*¬†""

Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings.

Critically, Librela & Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most.

Also per Morgan Stanley:

* ""we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0.73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1.01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)"" -- on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7.8%, pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already?? This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys.
* ""the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption, but for analysis purposes), would be 27.6x FY25 at the current share price, still below its 10-year historical average of 29.2x, suggesting the stock may be overly punished.""

Lastly, let's look at the technical side. ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart. If it continues to hold these levels, I think the risk reward from here will look very attractive!

957,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Morgan Stanley,219,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn‚Äôt realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn‚Äôt even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn‚Äôt been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it‚Äôs $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That‚Äôs because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don‚Äôt know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we‚Äôre one bad market day from the dam bursting. 

Long deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls.

**Background:** HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/hubspot-stock-jumps-amid-reports-google-parent-alphabet-considering-acquisition/ar-BB1l5hUX). The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.

**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.¬†

**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google‚Äôs ad business.
* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer.¬†

Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December[om here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)"

I‚Äôm not saying to make a play because I don‚Äôt know how long this will take to play out but this company literally has no AI tech, weird offerings, dilutions, Goldmans running the market, a history of fraud, being delisted and one of the largest SEC fines.  So many red flags 

I‚Äôm more on the tech side but there‚Äôs so many alarms about this stock and the offering by Goldmans. Plus think of SMCI selling metal enclosures to house GPUs and CPUs.  We had many SMCI boxes that are 5+ years old.  Yes we‚Äôd upgrade the GPU/CPU every few years but the metal enclosure servers that were SMCI we rarely ever upgrade beyond 5+ years.  

PSA Don‚Äôt be their exit liquidity.  Lots of red flags, maybe you take a chance when it was $90 but at $1000 up 1000%  in a year and with all these red flags it‚Äôs a terrible investment."

About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

The company I‚Äôm talking about is ‚ÄúGreenwave Technology solutions.‚Äù At first I was going to make a bait thread where I fucking edited the price of the stock out and only showed how many shares I owned and once you guys searched up the ticker symbol you‚Äôd fucking laugh your asses off or something lol. But while I was reading their financial statements I did get a bit curious about them, they had less than 10 thousand dollars in net revenues a couple years back, and were taking some serious financial losses even then. It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner, this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do, especially when shit hits the fan, so yeah, I respected that a lot. The company is a small business, it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market, neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them, thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, especially after corona. It hurts me even more since my father is a truck driver, my hats off to the guy, even if I feel like the financials look kind of like doo doo (negative cash flow üíÄ) I like this dudes drive and because of that I like the stonk. üòé"

Short interest is about 3.8% of float but there isn‚Äôt much float compared to the total number of shares. Outstanding shares is 5.8% of total, so 94.2% is held close. Could it be because the float is so small? Why is the float so small?

I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

‚Äã

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia‚Äôs trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures. This innovation is being increasingly adopted in sensors, memory chips, and logic devices due to its potential to enhance performance and functionality while simultaneously reducing size and costs‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã.

Adeia's hybrid bonding technology stands as a testament to the company's long-standing commitment to advancing the semiconductor industry. Over the past 30 years, Adeia has made fundamental advances in the field, holding an extensive portfolio of intellectual property that covers not just hybrid bonding but also advanced process nodes and packaging technologies‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã‚Äã. This latest development underscores Adeia's role in driving innovation in semiconductor technologies, which could have broad implications for the industry's future."
982,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,NetApp,8712,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."

I'm noticing that when Netflix makes this ""nail"" shape (I'm not well-versed in technical analysis) on a red day, the following trading day, the stock has a very good day.

So, I bought at 2PM when the price of $NFLX was $161.20-ish, and we closed down a little bit from that (I'm down about $50 as of now). I thought $NFLX had a chance to go green today, but it stopped short. 

We'll see if I have figured something out on Monday. If $NFLX doesn't do so hot, I'll hold my position until I'm back up - hopefully by the end of the week. Otherwise, I'm content on selling by the end of the day Monday.

All I can say is I'm on an absolute heater right now and I'm up 131% on the year. Should I quit while I'm ahead? Probably. But as long as I manage my risk properly... WHO AM I KIDDING? NETFLIX TO THE MOON!"

2. **Revenue Forecast** - For Q2, Meta expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint, $37.75 billion, represents an 18% year-over-year increase, though it's slightly below the average analyst estimate of $38.3 billion.

My dad, who has decided to hold Rivian shares until 0, has informed me that he thinks Netflix stock will \*\*\*\* the bed on earnings. I am so sorry to all Netflix bears, my dad will run your brokerage accounts dry. 

He says that its 'because he saw the financials' while working on a accounting software deliverable for SAP with Netflix as its customer. But, when I pressed for more specifics, he refused to elaborate. 

Betting against Netflix stock before earnings is no longer safe. My dad buys terrible companies regularly, and gets it wrong about the Mag 7. If you are betting against Netflix stock, your funds are not SAFU. 

On another note, Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count. This investor bank rated one star on Google Reviews has regularly delivered inaccurate stock recommendations to me. The only stock that it has accurately upgraded and downgraded consistently is William-Sonoma.

In conclusion, it will not be safe to bet against Netflix stock on Thursday.

998,Match Result: TKO,wallstreetbets,Netflix,9,6,11-04-2024 17:52:44,https://i.redd.it/5flqe6x42wtc1.jpeg,"What‚Äôs up Nerds! Long time lurker, first time poster here. I‚Äôve been doing a ton browsing while I wait for Season 2 of Earnings to get rolling and my countless hours of digging for golden tickers may be about to yield fruit. TKO. Let‚Äôs kick round 1 off.

TKO went public last year and was actually able to reach highs over 115 per share. Then the Vince McMahon scandle dropped and you saw the stock submit (üòè) to the market for a few months. Now with that turbulent period appearing further in their rear view, the stock has been on a path back to reclaim its belt.

Round 2. Now the ouster of someone like McMahon is bound to have positive effects for a stock but let‚Äôs take a look at their volume over the past few months. I‚Äôm highly regarded so please excuse wherever this graph ends up on the post. When we look at the SMA we are approaching the smoke and mirrors that is the golden cross. Now this is something I believe is normally reserved for day trading and even with that, a chart doesn‚Äôt mean shit if there‚Äôs not good news surrounding it. The good news however, seems to be in abundance for them. McMahon is gone, recent WWE event had record numbers, UFC 300 incoming (though I expect this to only be a shorter term juice), Netflix deal from January, growing viewership, and a sweet succulent earnings report in the first half of May. All of this in combination with the potential of a big run after a golden cross has me feeling bullish about their direction, even if only for the short term.

3rd and final round. Only 3 because idk how I would do a 5 prong championship round discussion. Over the past month they‚Äôve seen an average weekly increase in the value of their stock of ~$4 per share.  Can a pace like that continue? Not very likely, but even if that were to be cut in half I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely insane to see this stock get back to those 115 highs by earnings or even right after. I also think the value of that Netflix deal can give them a stronger forecast.

Playing this through earnings only so I‚Äôve grabbed May 17 105C. I‚Äôm still regarded and don‚Äôt know how I can include more than one picture. 55 contracts at average cost of 1.81. $9937.23 total on the line. 

Good luck to anyone currently holding or thinking of jumping in. And if you have reasons why they won‚Äôt continue to rise please share your thoughts as maybe I‚Äôve missed some important factors.

1000,Ramblings of a Remora: The size of the future AI market is truly hard to fathom and it's impact hard to imagine.,wallstreetbets,Netflix,10,14,05-04-2024 18:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwpl5n/ramblings_of_a_remora_the_size_of_the_future_ai/,"It begins as a ""tool"", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

Gold, silver, and copper are trading above their assumptions from last earnings are are up on the futures, while the price of oil is well below their assumes price for cost of operations.

On top of all of that the USD has remained strong while a good portion of their operations in other countries currencies remained weak. So lots of bonus margin on underlying expenses like Canadian or Chilean labour for example.

How do we benefit? Well, $NEM newmont is on a lot of big index ETFs that everyone holds, SPY, VOO, VTI, IWO, etc and of course the biggest holding in GDX. Why is this good? Because of how gamma and call options work. As the call options get bought, the MMs hedge by buying stock, as the stock price increases the passive ETFs increase weighting, then as the MMs sell the hedge as the options expire, the ETFs end up holding the stock.

Lots of upside here, a real company with real profits, real price growth, and a lot of upside. Druckenmiller bought in on this guy already, but we aren't far behind.

Newmont: after a steep sell off post missing their last quarter earnings Newmont has been on the rise. Supported by rising gold prices, a 32% y/y increase in production, and expansion of their mining operation sites I continue to have high beliefs in NEM. Earnings are out tomorrow pre-market. Currently trading at ‚âà $38 with a fair value estimate of $51

My positions: 40 $45 c exp 5/24 

Hecla: Another precious metals company that dominates the silver industry, has tracked growth similar to Newmont over the last two months, reopened production at one of their sites that was previously shut down to fire damage, and continued to expand their operation through new sites and expansion of existing ones. Earnings May 09

My positions: 120 $5 c expiring 5/10, 25 $6 c exp 5/10 , 20 $7 c leaps Jan 2025


The way I look at it, Gold and Silver do historically well in uncertain market times, increased production, and an election year. All signs in my pea brain point upward.

1004,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,News Corp (Class A),129,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

Rallied due to powell saying there won't br rate hike on the next meeting (duh), and obviously marker realized how BS the speech was and sold off. Close enough

2PM EST: FOMC announces no change in rates. Markets stay flat/minor rally due to surrounding fears for a rate hike. Personally shorting NQ if there is a rally. 

The relief rally (if any), will be completely sold off by the time the meeting stream starts.

Powell: ""Need to see more data to have an accurate gauge for inflation"" No they don't, what they're doing is not working. 

""Rate cut expectations are not to be forecasted in the near future"" Likely cut expectations for 2024 decreases to 1 or 2. Markets will likely start dumping or gradually selling off during the meeting.

""Inflation persisting more than expected"" Obviously. 

However, if Powell hits us with the line ""Further rate hikes are not off the table and potentially may be necessary and expected if conditions do not improve"", the markets will take the largest dump we will see in a while as everyone's fears are confirmed.

Personally, I don't think there will actually be any cuts for this year, with a hike more likely than rate decreases. Even though it's an election year, the data we've been getting have been perpetually atrocious, and fear is finally starting to gather up. I will stay cash into market open, and enter puts/shorts after the rate decision is announced and we rally a little bit. Will hold shorts throughout the meeting, as it will provide way more downside potential than any upside unless Powell explicitly confirms that three rate cuts are still guaranteed to be expected.

1008,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,264,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."
1009,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves",wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,449,356,29-04-2024 05:59:33,https://i.redd.it/g884d41bzcxc1.jpeg,"OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

1011,Mercedes level 3 vs tesla level 2 here‚Äôs why Tesla will be a big winner,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,0,134,28-04-2024 03:07:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ceweuo/mercedes_level_3_vs_tesla_level_2_heres_why_tesla/,"I‚Äôve seen in wsb the misinformation on how Tesla fsd is a joke, it will take another 20 yrs, Elon is a liar & keep telling Mercedes is level 3 autonomy, superior to Tesla

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let‚Äôs go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here‚Äôs the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, üêª open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won‚Äôt go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can‚Äôt make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

1012,IS ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL?,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,9,39,24-04-2024 20:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc982d/is_anyone_actually_bullish_about_ccl/,"Is anyone bullish about $CCL??? Honestly, take a look at the fundamentals, the bottom and top lines, and consider its potential for growth.

(Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = üöÄ potential.

Loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of 100+ ships.

Long-term play, potential 5x-10x return.)

I'm bullish about $CCL, and here's why:

First, let's take a look at the fundamentals. Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company, with a market cap of approximately $18.79 billion as of April 24, 2024. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78, indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity. Additionally, $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships, making it a major player in the cruise industry.

Now, let's consider the company's financial performance. In 2023, $CCL reported revenue of $24.5 billion, a significant increase from the $5.6 billion it reported in 2022. This indicates that the travel demand is surging, and $CCL is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

Moreover, $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4, compared to the industry average of 15. This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth.

The company's history also supports a bullish outlook. Before the pandemic, $CCL was a high-flying stock, with a P/E ratio of over 20. While the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, it has since recovered and is now back on track for growth.

Essentially, with a loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of over 100 ships, $CCL is a long-term play with the potential for a 5x-10x return. The surge in travel demand and the company's undervalued stock price make it an attractive investment opportunity."
1013,Your Thoughts on $CLS Celestica,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,12,15,23-04-2024 15:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cb7owb/your_thoughts_on_cls_celestica/,"Earnings on 4/24/2024. I hold stock and debating whether to pick up a call or two. Here are some bullish thoughts from my broker's research department:

Bottom Line: 
We remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1/24 results‚Äîas we believe that CLS will continue to benefit, both in the near-term and longer-term, from the large AI-driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers. We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity, nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative.

Key Points
We anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise. Consensus Q1/24 estimates call for revenue of $2.1b and adj. EPS of $0.72, while FY2024 consensus is at $8.78b for revenue and $2.93 for adj. EPS. Current FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of >$8.5b and adj. EPS of $2.70; however we believe it's clear that this is too conservative‚Äîgiven subsequent capex guidance from key customers, which suggests that demand is accelerating. Our expectation is that FY2024 guidance will be raised to a level that's similar to, although perhaps not above, current consensus.

We're unclear on where buyside consensus might stand, but in our view, the stock's current valuation and significant pullback from its recent peak suggest that a sizable beat isn't currently being priced in.

Proprietary silicon servers, and 800G, should drive ongoing share gains. We believe that CLS has stronger competitive differentiation with respect to AI servers that are based on proprietary silicon vs. NVIDIA. Large hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft appear likely to shift a growing proportion of their server spend towards the former vs. the latter, and we expect that CLS should benefit from this dynamic. Additionally, CLS has been awarded 800G design wins from some of its hyperscaler customers, which are slated to ramp later this year and into FY2025.

While competition is a key risk (particularly given CLS's customer concentration), we believe that this is mitigated by the aforementioned factors, and the fact that Street estimates are only assuming single-digit revenue growth in FY2025 despite strong demand tailwinds. Further, the Street isn't forecasting much in the way of margin expansion next year, and we believe this may also represent a source of incremental upside.

We've raised our target price to US$48, reflecting 15x CY2025E adj. P/E and 8.8x EV/EBITDA.

Our Thesis
We rate Celestica shares Outperform. We believe the stock's historical valuation discount to peers should continue to narrow given its revenue and margin trajectory, the significant improvements that CLS has made to its revenue mix in recent years, and its AI exposure.

Valuation
Our US$48 target price is based on a CY2025E adj. P/E multiple of 15x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.8x. We believe this is appropriate in the context of CLS's peer group given its relative size, growth profile and revenue mix.

Upside Scenario
$55.00
Our upside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate increases by 7%, perhaps driven by a stronger recovery in semi equipment and better-than-expected hyperscaler demand, and the stock's multiple expands to 16x adj. P/E.

Downside Scenario
$34.00
Our downside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate decreases by 7%, perhaps due to a softer demand backdrop, and the stock's multiple contracts to 11.5x adj. P/E."
1014,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,202,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

1016,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,127,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

1018,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

1019,Match Result: TKO,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,10,6,11-04-2024 17:52:44,https://i.redd.it/5flqe6x42wtc1.jpeg,"What‚Äôs up Nerds! Long time lurker, first time poster here. I‚Äôve been doing a ton browsing while I wait for Season 2 of Earnings to get rolling and my countless hours of digging for golden tickers may be about to yield fruit. TKO. Let‚Äôs kick round 1 off.

TKO went public last year and was actually able to reach highs over 115 per share. Then the Vince McMahon scandle dropped and you saw the stock submit (üòè) to the market for a few months. Now with that turbulent period appearing further in their rear view, the stock has been on a path back to reclaim its belt.

Round 2. Now the ouster of someone like McMahon is bound to have positive effects for a stock but let‚Äôs take a look at their volume over the past few months. I‚Äôm highly regarded so please excuse wherever this graph ends up on the post. When we look at the SMA we are approaching the smoke and mirrors that is the golden cross. Now this is something I believe is normally reserved for day trading and even with that, a chart doesn‚Äôt mean shit if there‚Äôs not good news surrounding it. The good news however, seems to be in abundance for them. McMahon is gone, recent WWE event had record numbers, UFC 300 incoming (though I expect this to only be a shorter term juice), Netflix deal from January, growing viewership, and a sweet succulent earnings report in the first half of May. All of this in combination with the potential of a big run after a golden cross has me feeling bullish about their direction, even if only for the short term.

3rd and final round. Only 3 because idk how I would do a 5 prong championship round discussion. Over the past month they‚Äôve seen an average weekly increase in the value of their stock of ~$4 per share.  Can a pace like that continue? Not very likely, but even if that were to be cut in half I don‚Äôt think it‚Äôs completely insane to see this stock get back to those 115 highs by earnings or even right after. I also think the value of that Netflix deal can give them a stronger forecast.

Playing this through earnings only so I‚Äôve grabbed May 17 105C. I‚Äôm still regarded and don‚Äôt know how I can include more than one picture. 55 contracts at average cost of 1.81. $9937.23 total on the line. 

Good luck to anyone currently holding or thinking of jumping in. And if you have reasons why they won‚Äôt continue to rise please share your thoughts as maybe I‚Äôve missed some important factors.

1020,My bearish thesis on $META,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,0,35,11-04-2024 00:32:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c11efx/my_bearish_thesis_on_meta/,"The stock is ripe for pull back. Somehow META has managed to stay off the radar in this rally. 

Litigation- The FTC wants to tighten an existing 2020 Facebook privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial recognition technology. The agency has accused Meta of misleading parents about protections for children. The FTC also wants undo the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming Meta illegally maintains a monopoly in ‚Äúpersonal social networking‚Äù. If these go through it will be a massive blow to the bottom line. Twitter is also suing Meta claiming Threads copied their business and trade secret theft, we'll see how this plays out. Lets also mention the never ending regulatory fines and litigation with European agencies.  All these issues are a serious liability for the company.

The competition- The single biggest threat to Meta is TikTok. The reason they are lobbying so hard to get it banned. People migrate to the next big thing, older generations dont like change so i fully expect them to stay with Facebook until the end but the smart money saw whats happening with TikTok, how fast its taken over the younger generation and they want it, all of it. Steven Mnuchin is a smart man, he knows at the current rate of TikToks growth its going to overtake Facebook and Instagram within the next 2-3 years. Its in a hyper growth stage and Meta has simply stalled out. 

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/14/former-treasury-secretary-mnuchin-is-putting-together-an-investor-group-to-buy-tiktok.html)

TikTok is also launching a direct competitor to Instagram and WhatsApp, very soon. Those users 35 and under  currently on Insta will easily migrate over to the newest thing. There is no loyalty to a service or app. If you are spending most of your time already watching tiktok, you can easily switch over to Notes, no need to go back to Instagram if all your friend are posting videos,pictures and chatting on TikTok. More time spent on Tiktok, less time on Meta apps.

&#x200B;

The presidential election- The Presidential ad spending is always massive and grows each year but its very limited. Only 28.1 percent goes to digital marketing, most goes toward tv ads not small facebook, google and newspaper ads.

AI - Meta announced their AI plans even making their own chips, or designing their own chips. This seems like a last ditch effort to stay relevant and a costly venture like the metaverse. I don't see what meta could do with AI other than mine peoples data more efficiently and sell it. Picture and video AI is limited, there's so many third party apps that can do it better. 

Meta is running out of ideas, the company has peaked, we may start to see declining revenue and user activity year after year. The balance of influence is shifting. Meta had its run, time to join Myspace. 

lastly the dividend, another effort to keep investors around. You can get a higher yield and take less risk holding a treasury bond. "
1021,"PAA - Why it can go higher, even if oil doesnt",wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,290,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

[Volume is trending over average by 20&#37;-50&#37;](https://preview.redd.it/3petzkbmdctc1.png?width=2262&format=png&auto=webp&s=74d953061f2a3a6967bbd9e26b87c4289f45486a)

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**GamePlan**

**I like Aug/Nov 2024 ($20c-$25c) and Jan 2026 LEAPs ($20c to $25c).  I think 2025 is a bit crowded and I like the extra delta that the MMs would need to hedge on the 2026s.  Shorter dated calls are also an option as that could positively affect the price.**

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Too tired to write more...

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

1200 Jan 2026 calls from $20-$25

I would be happy with 1%-2% increase a week in the stock, we have 9-21 months for the LEAPs"
1022,Food for thought - CCL - 5/17 $16c,wallstreetbets,Norwegian Cruise Line Holdings,25,36,05-04-2024 16:39:21,https://www.reddit.com/gallery/1bwmn4k,"You‚Äôre probably wondering why I‚Äôve gathered you all here today. 

CCL has had a positive operating profit for four straight quarters. Last month CCL reported its first-quarter earnings, for the period that ended Feb 29. Not only did revenue totaling $5.4 billon rise 22% year over year, but bookings are at all time highs. In Q1 customer deposits topped $7B, which is higher than the previous posted bookings last year at $5.7B

Around 12.46M passengers in 2023. Booking numbers suggest that unlike other industries, the cruise business might be inflation resistant since it caters to a more affluent customer base. Furthermore, cruising companies are particularly resilient to recessions, as you can observe in the graphs for the Worldwide Cruise Industry Passengers and Carnival Total Passengers. During the 2008 recession, the total cruise passenger volume remained steady and continued to increase AND CCL plans to expand capacity berths by nearly 5,000 by 2025.

In 2023 there were an estimated 31.5M passengers in the worldwide cruise industry and is expected to increase to 39.5M by 2027, which means an annual growth in passengers of 6.34% through 2027. CCL also holds a 39.5% market share, ahead of RCL and NCLH.

CCL has a large enough fleet to operate at lower margins and therefore offer lower fares. Any new company willing to offer to cruise for the middle class would need to focus on luxury cruising because it will not be able to compete in pricing with CCL nor with RCL. This same thing applies to cruise companies with smaller market shares. 

RCL has also beat earning estimates the past four quarters and their Q1 ER is 5/2 P/M. NCLH has beat earnings 3/4 (missing in Q4) and Q1 ER coming P/M 4/29. I expect a beat on both and expect a slight move between the three for each ER. Out of the three CCL is HIGHLY undervalued compared to the others and expect a little more traffic coming in. Excellent value play/long term hold. 



-CON-
CCL‚Äôs long-term debt sits at $28.5B which is a big reason many investors are wary about investing in the stock right now. 

-HOWEVER-

During last quarter CCL‚Äôs operating cashflow was a positive $1.8B, which is a huge improvement from the $400M this time last year. 

CCL released three new cruise ships for its Excel Class from 2021 and 2023. They announced a new 180,000 ton ship order for 2027. Weinstein stated, ‚ÄúOur responsible capital approach will support utilizing our substantial free cash flow over the next several years to strategically improve our balance sheet, significantly reduce our leverage levels and continue to transfer value from debt holders to shareholders‚Äù

I‚Äôm confident there‚Äôs money to be made here. Love to hear some thoughts on this."

In much the same way most of us settle for streamed movies vs Bluray due to cost and conveinience, I can totally see gaming going in this direction sooner than we think. 

The ability to instantly load up any game without installation and run it on a max spec machine is amazing.  The quality and framerate is noticably worse still but nonetheless suprisingly fine for a casual session.  

How long do you feel before most people no longer choose to own consoles or high end PCs and just subscribe to gaming services?  What do you think will happen to companies like Playstation and Nintendo who sell so many hardware units?    And what about companies Nvidias GPUs moving from mass consumer owned to almost exclusively data centre owned?

Honestly even today, as a casual gamer, I would 100% choose to just subscribe to XCloud than drop $2K on a GPU. I think this paradigm shift in the consumer owned hardware market is going to happen pretty fast. "

Government seems heavily invested. Maybe not a 10x like Nvidia but who knows?

If Intel's aggressive manufacturing revamp pays off, the company could snag back its process technology crown. The 18A node specifically has the potential to outperform anything TSMC currently offers. This would not only revitalize Intel's own chip production but could open the door to becoming a foundry for competitors.

Intel's Gaudi AI accelerators are already gaining traction. The upcoming Gaudi 3 promises significant performance leaps and could seriously challenge Nvidia's market dominance. Price-performance advantages and easy integration with popular AI frameworks could make Gaudi 3 a darling with enterprises scaling up AI deployments.

Intel is keenly focused on streamlining the notoriously complex world of AI software development. New software suites tailored for their AI hardware could create a compelling ecosystem for developers, attracting businesses and researchers alike. Increased ease-of-use is a major catalyst for broader adoption."

At least a 5% further drop from
$169 levels.To $160 or lower.

I just cannot see any good news
except the fairly bullish open interest on the latest option contracts.
But is that enough ?

Even Jim Cramer is quietly bearish as of April 24,2024.

Reason one.
Apple had a death cross on March 14,2024.Just over 7 weeks ago.
Long time to be under the 200 days moving average .

Current 200 days Simple Moving Average is $181.36 per share.

Current 50 days Simple Moving Average is $173.29 per share.

Current 14 days Relative Strength Index is a 47.33 
Definitely not oversold by any means.
In the low 30‚Äôs it would be oversold and ripe for a strong bounce.

In the case of Apple stock, its 50-day ‚Äúline crossed below its 200-day line on March 14,2024.

The last time Apple did that was in June 2022, and the stock was already several weeks into a major decline. 

The two lines touched again in September 2022 and the death cross expanded from there.

https://www.investors.com/research/apple-stock-aapl-death-cross/


The Death Cross is a technical analysis pattern in the stock market that occurs when a short-term moving average crosses below a long-term moving average. 

Typically, the Death Cross involves the 50-day moving average crossing below the 200-day moving average.

This pattern is considered bearish and may suggest a potential reversal of an uptrend, indicating that a stock or market might be entering a period of decline.

Reason two.
Apple had a double top of $199.37 in December 2023 and $196.13 in January 2024.
This is extremely significant.

A double top is an extremely bearish technical reversal pattern that forms after an asset reaches a high price two consecutive times with a moderate decline between the two highs.

It is confirmed once the asset's price falls below a support level equal to the low between the two prior highs.

The double top pattern is a bearish reversal pattern that can be observed at the top of an uptrend and signals an impending reversal.

The double top chart pattern resembles the letter ‚ÄúM‚Äù, due to the two equal highs.

A double top is a chart pattern that signals the end of an uptrend. 

Therefore, when the market forms a double top, close out long positions (sell)before prices fall. 

You can also take a short position (short sell) to profit from the market's decline or buy put options on the stock. 

The double top pattern can be a very profitable and highly predictable price action pattern.Usually dramatic drops over the next 2 weeks to 2 months of the second peak price.

Reason three.
Apple broke below its recent double bottom of $167.19 in September 2023
and $165.24 in October 2023.

In April 2024 Apple dropped to a $164 range over 3 days or from April 19 to 23,2024.
The 48 to 68 million was not convincing or heavy enough to suggest that a major low had truly formed on Apple stock.

If it was one day,it would be okay.
But for 3 consecutive days of $164 range trading is a bit much.
Trouble in Apple paradise or further downside coming soon ?


Double Bottom breakdowns on charts are bearish patterns that mark a downside support break.

But you might say the breakdown was only $1.00 or less from last 6 months highs.


Reason four.
Apple is below its 20 days moving average of $169.37.
Where it has been much of the last 3 months.
Apple stock current price is 
$169.30

Reason five.
Apple hit another double top formation recently.
Hit $178.67 in March 2024 and $178.36 in April 2024.
And more worrisome,it broke the neckline of $167 per share in April 2024.
Very bad.

Reason six.
Apple‚Äôs market share declines in China by 25% year over year according to Canalys Report.

Apple declined the most among the top five, with 10.0 million units, a year-on-year decrease of 25%. Canalys Senior Analyst Toby Zhu commented.
Pronounced downtrend.
Not a good trend.

iPhone sales spiral 25% in China as Apple drops from first place to fifth.
April 26,2024

According to Canalys, Apple saw its shipments in China hit 10 million units in Q1 2024, a decrease of 25% year-over-year. 

This gives Apple a 15% share of the Chinese smartphone market, down from the 20% share it held at the same time last year.


https://9to5mac.com/2024/04/26/iphone-shipments-china-q1-2024-decline/

https://canalys.com/newsroom/china-smartphone-market-Q1-2024

With the continued expansion of the HarmonyOS ecosystem, Huawei emerges as the third OS for smartphones and other edge computing devices, breaking the two-horse race of Android and iOS in Mainland China.That is a big deal.

Apple is expanding its manufacturing outside of China.
Definitely a good thing.

But can the India manufacturing and sales help overcome the 25% China drop in units or iPhones.

Here is a sign of things to come for Apple stock.

For years, eight words were stamped on the back of every iPhone: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Assembled in China.‚Äù The slogan illustrated the tech giant‚Äôs two power bases: its headquarters in Silicon Valley and the manufacturing giant it had become in the factory of the world.

Apple no longer lists the words on the back of the iPhone. When the company launched a new supplier transparency website earlier this month, the phrase was updated: ‚ÄúDesigned by Apple in California. Made by people everywhere.‚Äù

Reason seven.

Expected EPS for May 2,2024 is 
$1.51

The latest earnings whisper is $1.50

Expected revenue for May 2,2024
is $90.61 billion.

The latest revenue whisper is
$89.79 billion.


How can Apple meet these earnings and revenue with the huge 25% drops in units in China in its most recent quarter,

Make the revenue shortfall from India and Europe.

According to revenue and earnings whispers,Apple will barely be under expected earnings and revenue.

Based on this, Apple should drop on earnings date.

Unless Apple gives strong guidance regarding AI or Artificial Intelligence during the earnings call.

But what about Apple Watch sales.
And Vision Pro sales.
Plus the iCar exit.

Reason eight.
Apple Vision Pro sales tank.

According to prominent analyst Ming-Chi Kuo, Apple has revised its Apple Vision Pro shipment expectations for 2024 down to 400,000 to 450,000 units.

Apple originally expected to sell as many as 800,000 Apple Vision Pro units this year, reports Kuo, who has accurately broken news on the company over the years due to his supply chain contacts.

The Apple Vision Pro is undoubtedly a flop as of April 2024.When is the last time you heard anything good about it in the news.Disappeared like lightning.

Will the ‚ÄúiCar‚Äù Exit Impact Apple Stock.

Why Apple scrapped its autonomous vehicle (AV) project, while iPhone earnings could be a bigger concern.

Are you bearish or bullish on Apple 
stock.
Could a steep drop after earnings begin bigger drops in the SP500 index or SPY ETF.

Reason nine.

Jim Cramer is bearish on Apple stock.

Jim Cramer said on April 22,2024 or on Cramer‚Äôs Mad Dash that Apple could hit $160 after earnings report on May 2,2024.

That is a huge $9 drop from current April 26,2024 levels of $169 per share.


Despite all these nine negatives,
the options market is extremely bullish for May 2,2024.

The put call open interest ratio is decidedly bullish at 0.57 for the May 3,2024 contracts.

A falling put-call ratio, or below 0.7 and approaching 0.5, is considered a bullish indicator

For May 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.17 to 0.66
Very bullish.

For June 2024 the put call open interest ratio varies from 0.32 to 0.72 
Definitely bullish.

The average investor thinks Apple is headed in the wrong direction.
Maximum pessimism.

Morgan Stanley likes Apple stock.

But even suggest that there will be post-earnings weakness and that Apple will significantly lower guidance or a 4 to 7% drop for next quarter.

Buy the dip on tech stocks like Apple and Nvidia ahead of earnings, Morgan Stanley says.

We believe Apple will slightly beat March 2024 Quarter ests, but guide to June Quarter revs/implied EPS 4-7% below Street. 

At $165, this appears priced in but in today‚Äôs volatile market, it‚Äôs a tricky setup. 

That said, with Apple‚Äôs biggest WWDC ever on June 10th, we‚Äôd buy post-earnings weakness. Remain OW; $210 PT.

If Apple drops on opening of May 3,2024 will SPY 1 day options bought on May 2,2024 be a smart play for the next day.
Hint.

In other words,will the Apple stock drop trigger a 1% plus drop on the SPY ETF.Very likely.

What say you regards.
Listen to the option investors or options money flow.

Or is Jim Cramer right on Apple."

- AI is an extremely hot topic, with heavy investments on the horizon in the hardware to run this advanced software. These cutting-edge chips are only produced through ASML‚Äôs EUV technology.

1043,Your Thoughts on $CLS Celestica,wallstreetbets,Nvidia,13,15,23-04-2024 15:37:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cb7owb/your_thoughts_on_cls_celestica/,"Earnings on 4/24/2024. I hold stock and debating whether to pick up a call or two. Here are some bullish thoughts from my broker's research department:

Bottom Line: 
We remain Outperform on CLS and have raised our estimates and target price ahead of Q1/24 results‚Äîas we believe that CLS will continue to benefit, both in the near-term and longer-term, from the large AI-driven capex investments being made by its hyperscaler customers. We believe the stock's valuation doesn't adequately reflect its market position and exposure with respect to this opportunity, nor the fact that Street estimates (and our own) are likely conservative.

Key Points
We anticipate a solid quarter and guidance raise. Consensus Q1/24 estimates call for revenue of $2.1b and adj. EPS of $0.72, while FY2024 consensus is at $8.78b for revenue and $2.93 for adj. EPS. Current FY2024 guidance calls for revenue of >$8.5b and adj. EPS of $2.70; however we believe it's clear that this is too conservative‚Äîgiven subsequent capex guidance from key customers, which suggests that demand is accelerating. Our expectation is that FY2024 guidance will be raised to a level that's similar to, although perhaps not above, current consensus.

We're unclear on where buyside consensus might stand, but in our view, the stock's current valuation and significant pullback from its recent peak suggest that a sizable beat isn't currently being priced in.

Proprietary silicon servers, and 800G, should drive ongoing share gains. We believe that CLS has stronger competitive differentiation with respect to AI servers that are based on proprietary silicon vs. NVIDIA. Large hyperscalers such as Google and Microsoft appear likely to shift a growing proportion of their server spend towards the former vs. the latter, and we expect that CLS should benefit from this dynamic. Additionally, CLS has been awarded 800G design wins from some of its hyperscaler customers, which are slated to ramp later this year and into FY2025.

While competition is a key risk (particularly given CLS's customer concentration), we believe that this is mitigated by the aforementioned factors, and the fact that Street estimates are only assuming single-digit revenue growth in FY2025 despite strong demand tailwinds. Further, the Street isn't forecasting much in the way of margin expansion next year, and we believe this may also represent a source of incremental upside.

We've raised our target price to US$48, reflecting 15x CY2025E adj. P/E and 8.8x EV/EBITDA.

Our Thesis
We rate Celestica shares Outperform. We believe the stock's historical valuation discount to peers should continue to narrow given its revenue and margin trajectory, the significant improvements that CLS has made to its revenue mix in recent years, and its AI exposure.

Valuation
Our US$48 target price is based on a CY2025E adj. P/E multiple of 15x and EV/EBITDA multiple of 8.8x. We believe this is appropriate in the context of CLS's peer group given its relative size, growth profile and revenue mix.

Upside Scenario
$55.00
Our upside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate increases by 7%, perhaps driven by a stronger recovery in semi equipment and better-than-expected hyperscaler demand, and the stock's multiple expands to 16x adj. P/E.

Downside Scenario
$34.00
Our downside scenario assumes that our CY2025E EPS estimate decreases by 7%, perhaps due to a softer demand backdrop, and the stock's multiple contracts to 11.5x adj. P/E."

Interest rates aren't coming down at all so kiss those margin lips goodbye.

What's crazy is why wouldn't he offer 0.00% financing considering when you buy a Tesla you lose about 30% in value as soon as you drive it off the lot.

What about this doozy of a foresight

>It's a longshot worth taking because the payoff potential is very high, but it's not a sure thing at all. It's a high-risk, high-payoff program,"" Musk said. ""Dojo is working and it is doing training jobs; we are scaling it up and we have plans for Dojo 1.5, Dojo 2 and Dojo 3. It's got potential but can't emphasize enough: high risk, high payoff.

I don't know, Jensen Huang said he has this ready for any car company to develop and tailor to their needs. All they have to do is buy the ""chips"".

[Nvidia Drive](https://preview.redd.it/e64uokb6t4wc1.png?width=1537&format=png&auto=webp&s=fbcc23c246f35290643393cc6d021d4df14fde7b)

Nvidia drive is getting trained by synthetic data in a digital twin. All that data capturing by Tesla owners will be nothing compared to the endless synthetic situations that can train the Nvidia drive platform along with data capture.

The point is, Robotaxis aren't going to be a only Tesla thing. They will be an entire automotive autonomous driving thing for many players.

This is devastating because while Mr. Musk may mention Robotaxis 1000 times on this earnings call it will ring hollow to the rest of the industry listening. Yeah, we can do that too.

And all of that is before 1 law even allows Robotaxis to exist in the first place. Look for that legislation to pass in 2030 in the shortest period possible once they prove this technology won't kill people.

But there's more

Tesla is building robots too and they should be ready next year. Again, Jensen Huang just eating that lunch. See here's a thing that some of you didn't know. Story time. Once upon a time Elon invested in a company called OpenAI. After some infighting, arguing and things happening Elong decided to give OpenAI and ultimatum if they wanted to continue to exist. He told them to fold OpenAI into Tesla and they were like Nah bro we good.

In a big brain smooth move Elon said ok and peaced out.

So the thing that could power Optimus's brain in the best way is not at Tesla. It's at Microsoft. Good one Elon.

>After spending the past year teasing continuous upgrades to Tesla's Optimus project, Musk said that the company has a chance of shipping ""some number of Optimus units next year.""¬†

So what does it all mean? If you ask me I say the chickens are coming home to roost.

If Tesla can't maintain the last blockade of selling pressure of $138 - $135 the dam will break and this stock goes to $100 in a matter of weeks.

Matter of weeks? Mmm, maybe a matter of days.

In the end, it was just a car company. Do I think this is the end of Tesla? No, I think it's a great company. It may just be time for a leadership change and a massive investment in charging stations with a 0.00% apr buy down so they can sell units and FSD.

I do think they can turn things around but let's be clear. There is no amount of fairy dust Musk can put on this pig in the short term. He's going to have to work his way out of it. The competition is fierce and the headwinds are coming for Tesla like we've never seen before.

I don't know who is still shitting out fantasy numbers and price points of $294 but you have to be kidding. Or who's saying this has the opportunity to be largest and greatest tech company in the world. This ain't it.

Cathy Wood has stopped buying Tesla and Wedbush is about off this train too. You can make money off of this too. Don't miss this falling knife hit the floor.

here's the price action and it's a sight to behold

There aren't many other companies actually making money from AI, since there aren't real use cases where it's actually useful in a B2B case. 

OpenAI did a great job of promoting Gen AI as being the magical solution, we've all seen the article claiming that AI paid a human on Taskrabbit to solve a reCAPTCHA, but that never actually happened.

1054,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Nvidia,215,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

I can't think of a person leaving a company and just decimating the competition on the way out while blessing his former employer with the highest praise.

He's saying there is no chance in hell for others to catch up and not anytime soon.

I don't know if this is news but it should be. He's effectively saying AMD, Intel and whoever the hell else is thinking about their own chips just forget about it.

Here is why I believe the same thing. Claude Opus which is almost comparable to GPT 4 allows you to have 40 messages a day. That is just dire and completely inadequate for any real workload. And the responses come back in moments compared to GPT.

GPT5 is almost here and I don't think the world is ready for what that is going to be. Sora is already insanely ridiculous with Google's AI Chief, Demis Hassabis, and I quote, "" it could be difficult for Google to draw level with OpenAI's Sora."" And that's ALL GPU's folks.

If one major player or sovereign nation state gives up on the pursuit of AGI they will be behind in a severely detrimental manner.

1057,TSLA earnings ,wallstreetbets,Nvidia,32,48,15-04-2024 02:13:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4avx7/tsla_earnings/,"I see Tesla going either way, however I‚Äôm leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. 

1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. 

2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it‚Äôs dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it‚Äôs designed for)
Edit: saw this right after postingüòÇ 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE

3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point‚Ä¶

4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?

Now of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. 
 
1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn‚Äôt all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. 

2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it‚Äôs even more bullish. 

3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. 

In conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?ü§î 

This is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. "

The turnaround story is now a stunning comeback and revenue growth story. The estimate was 154m in revenues and BB delivered an impressive 173m  with 25% growth year over year in the IoT segment. BB is well positioned in high growth sectors with limitless opportunity especially in automotive which saw huge momentum in 2023 for example global car sales numbers were up 28% in China, the world largest car market hit 30 million cars. UK sales numbers were up 18% and the Philippines and India broke records with India reaching 4 million cars sold for the 1st time in hitory. In the US market Feb alone car sales numbers were up by a whopping 9.6% over last year same month and Ford EV traction and GM both were at record high. BB stand to benefit tremendously from automotive sector momentum particularly in China since they have brilliantly created strong strategic partnerships with top EV makers including BYD which surpassed Tesla recently as the number one EV seller in the world. Another key BB EV maker partner is Xiaomi, they launched an electric car SU7 with preorders started at 10:00pm China time. A surprise firm 30,000 orders recorded in 27 minutes. Pre-orders hit 50,000 in the 1st 24 hours. Foxconn also is another big win for BB and they are launching heir 1st EV in 2025 with Blackberry QNX inside.

I feel obligated to post this after reading through a few threads and being shocked at the misinformation in this sub.

I believe Tesla is at the cusp of solving autonomous driving. I'll go over some of the points that people are not considering/misunderstanding in the following text.

""They've been doing this for years and it's still nothing more than advanced cruise control."" This misses a huge detail. FSD V12 is fundamentally a different architecture from all previous versions. V11 had 300k + C programming, V12 has removed all of this, shifting the approach to an end-to-end solution. This has always been the endpoint; end-to-end is scalable and easily trained, it learns by itself instead of being programmed by limited humans. Tesla is one of the biggest customers of NVIDIA's GPUs, Elon Musk tweeted a month ago (see image attached) that compute is no longer a bottleneck. You could claim Elon is just lying but the proof is in the pudding. FSD V12 has been having a steady and fast update release schedule. We are now in V12.3.4 after several updates. The fact that the software shifted to fully self-learning AI means now you just need two things: data (good diversity, non-simulated, and proprietary data) and compute. Compute doesn't seem to be a current bottleneck so let's see how the data is looking.

Take a look at the image attached showing miles driven while using FSD. Data that falls under this category is important as interventions are one of the most important data types; it allows you to see the difference between what the software would've done and where the human disagrees. It's straightforward to see why this is invaluable. As you can see, this graph represents an obvious exponential growth, and it isn't slowing down in the upcoming months. Half the eligible fleet (US and Canada) still hasn't got/downloaded the free month trial. Subscription cost just lowered to $99 a month from $200. People on Twitter are overwhelmingly impressed and shocked at the quality. Whoever has the software, I ask you to give it a test drive again if you weren't impressed at first and you'll be shocked.

This amount of data coupled with the compute Tesla has, gives the company a SIGNIFICANT advantage in the pursuit of creating a generalized driving solution that is scalable. Tesla has 6 million+ vehicles collecting millions of frames of data a day. No one else has this much access to real-world relevant data, no one. Rivalling Tesla on compute is also extremely expensive, and without the data to train it, it makes no financial sense.

Don't sleep on Tesla, I've never seen such a mismatch of sentiment vs technology in my life.

Guys, it seems like tomorrow NVIDIA will sky rocket up, on the day of October 7th Hammas attack Nvidia only dropped 3.7% when market opened on Monday there was a further dropped (Within that 3.7%) to $444 then sky rocketed back up and yesterday market already $25, maybe pre-market dropped a little bit more on Monday then shoots up as soon as market opens (Priced in already)

No way just a few missile strikes that Isreal intercepted 99% of it would have that much more negative impact and further more those that hit was already reported to not have any substantial damage to the military base and no reported casualities as of yet

1063,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,Nvidia,653,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."

Good day fellow degenerates!

Some of you asked me to post an updated photo of my INTC position, but before, a few words. Since my DD, Intel has pretty much been shitting the bed, selling off anything that would be considered ‚Äúgood news‚Äù and tanking on the slightest ‚Äúbad news‚Äù. China not using US chips in CCP computers? Surprise, surprise, tank. Intel posting FY 2023 results again, -8%, lol. Latest one I really liked, Intel introducing Gaudi3 as a capable NVDA competitor, -3% the next day. 

Now, does all of this make sense? In some sense of course, the market is always right. In some other sense maybe not so much. At this stock price Intel is trading only 43% above its book value ([https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book](https://www.macrotrends.net/stocks/charts/INTC/intel/price-book)). This does not take into account the fact that they plan to add 110 billion more to the book over the next 3 years, which would make them trade *under* their book value right now. This is fucking huge for a company that essentially makes a pile of their revenue with exactly this book value.

Their latest *AI* processor, Meteor Lake is already sold out for some of the main vendors. On the contrary, I could barely find any vendor that equips its products with the direct competitor, Ryzen 9. No surprise, Intel smoked AMD in the 2023 Client Computing segment already. And they are just getting started: their newest processor lines, Arrow Lake and Lunar Lake are already to be found in OEM test devices ([https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html](https://www.notebookcheck.net/Massive-Arrow-Lake-leak-reveals-Intel-ditching-new-cores-introduced-with-Meteor-Lake-no-Arc-iGPU-and-more.809838.0.html) and [https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu](https://www.tomsguide.com/computing/laptops/forget-meteor-lake-samsung-just-leaked-intels-next-gen-lunar-lake-cpu)) and they are unmatched by anything else on the market (Lunar Lake providing >100 platform TOPS, with even the new Snapdragon Elite only reaching 75). Those chips are already using, amongst others, the 20A process, meaning that they are *ahead* of TSMC‚Äôs process, resulting in an enormous performance and efficiency increase.

The big players (MSFT, GOOG, META) team up with Intel on both the software and hardware side ([https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/](https://www.japantimes.co.jp/business/2024/03/26/tech/plot-nvidia-grip-ai-software/) and [https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/](https://www.dqindia.com/ibm-meta-intel-sony-and-dell-unites-for-ai-alliance-to-challenge-industry-titans/)) and especially MSFT pushing the cooperation with Intel‚Äôs AI processors hard. With Gaudi3 and this solid software stack, getting a grip in the datacenter segment is imminent. People like to compare Gaudi3 to Blackwell, but Gaudi3 already ships to OEMs, while Blackwell will only be available in limited quantities starting 2025.

So, you may call me a degenerate idiot, I will take it with the same pride as all of you take it. I increased my INTC position by about 50% after the recent ‚Äúfoundry loss‚Äù dip. As you can see, it has dropped further, but well, who said making money was easy. When others are fearful then there is some blood on the street or some shit like that. However, no time pressure with shares, which is pretty valuable for a company that is undervalued, literally not allowed to go bankrupt and about to fucking bigly enter the opportunity of this decade.   


Enjoy wanking!

&#x200B;

The announcement came just one day after Intel (INTC) unveiled its Gaudi 3 accelerator for enterprise gen AI. Coincidentally, on the same day, Alphabet's Google (GOOG)(GOOGL) showcased its latest in-house chips, Axion, to help the tech giant address rising computing costs, handle more AI-related workloads and cut its reliance on outside vendors such as Nvidia (NVDA).

&#x200B;

Social media titan Meta's latest generation of the Meta Training and Inference Accelerator, MTIA, designed for AI-workloads, are intended to power its ranking and recommendation ads models.

&#x200B;

""As AI workloads become increasingly important to our products and services, this efficiency will improve our ability to provide the best experiences for our users around the world,"" the company said.

&#x200B;

The latest MTIA more than doubles the compute and memory bandwidth of its predecessor, which was released last year.

&#x200B;

""To support the next-generation silicon, we have developed a large, rack-based system that holds up to 72 accelerators,"" Meta said. ""We specifically designed the system so that we could clock the chip at 1.35GHz (up from 800 MHz) and run it at 90 watts compared to 25 watts for our first-generation design.""

&#x200B;

Meta also updated the software stack, PyTorch, associated with the upgraded MTIA chips. The company also created Triton, an open source language and compiler for writing highly efficient ML compute kernels, to maximize hardware utilization.

&#x200B;

""We currently have several programs underway aimed at expanding the scope of MTIA, including support for GenAI workloads,"" Meta added.

1070,NVDA - bottom not in,wallstreetbets,Nvidia,0,22,10-04-2024 12:23:15,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0k9nh/nvda_bottom_not_in/,"I have been closely following NVIDIA (NVDA) for some time now. There are a couple of key events I'd like to highlight:

**Earnings**: NVDA did report strong earnings, but the initial market reaction was a decline in the stock price, suggesting the numbers weren't as impressive as the market had anticipated. Of course, it took off as market shook off the numbers and continued to pile in. While NVDA achieved an impressive 80% margin amid strong growth, high margins tend to attract competition, which is something to watch out for going forward.

**GTC (NVIDIA's GPU Technology Conference)**: Despite all the hype around this event, NVDA stock barely saw a bump in reaction. This was somewhat underwhelming given the importance of this conference.  

Overall, I believe NVDA's stock has run up too far, too fast. I expect it to pull back further towards the pre-earnings level of around $650 before the last earnings report. From there, I think the stock could run back up to the $750-$800 range as earnings continue to impress, but might struggle to justify prices above $900.

Given this outlook, I'm taking a cautious stance and plan to stay on the sidelines until the stock hits around $650. At that point, I'll reevaluate the market conditions and trade accordingly. For this quarter, I'm laying off NVDA to see how things play out."

In looking at the financials of GUESS and the current market opinion, I have strong confidence in the stock being a worthy purchase.

Financial Information:

Recently they had announced their earnings in which they had beat expectations. With an expected of 1.56 EPS vs a reported 2.01 EPS, and 856.64M expected revenue vs 891.05M reported revenue. This resulted in the stock popping up 20% from $25 to around $31.

Why Purchase Now?

Even though the significant gains from their earnings has already been shown, the company now plans on making their investors happy. The CEO announced a special dividend of $2.25 per share and a $200 million [share buy back](https://investors.guess.com/news-releases/news-release-details/guess-inc-board-authorizes-new-200-million-share-repurchase). You might say, ""Cool, there is a special dividend, why should I care"", well you should care because of how the market is currently treating the overall company. According to [Marketwatch](https://www.marketwatch.com/investing/stock/ges?mod=mw_quote_tab) 26.39% of the public float is shorted, compare this to other companies like NVIDIA with only 1.26% shorted, or LULU which only has 3.15% shorted whilst having bad earnings, bad outlook, and being a clothing brand. This implies that the CEO intends for this to be a short squeeze. They are buying their shares back, making shorters lose money, making them in turn buy to cover their positions, and then driving up the stock. On top of that, owning the stock won't just have a chance for a dramatic increase, but the special dividend will pay any shareholder hansomely for owning before April 17th.

Conclusion:

Even though there are some doubts around this clothing brand, the postition it is taking against those that are looking at the company's downfall is aggresive and interesting. Comparing GUESS to other clothing brands, this is the one to buy, even if it is just for the special dividend. I hope you guys like my opinion, and Id love to hear what others think.

**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

EDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns

EDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of

Hindsight Report, added the morning of 4/10 pre-market:

TSMC‚Äôs revenue report came in at 195k, a whopping 34% YoY increase from March of 2023, and a mere 8k short of my low-end prediction; however, the stock spiked very high just before the report was released, then fell off pretty quick shortly after the report was released, I imagine it experienced a little bit of a pump-and-dump over in the Taiwan market. This is most likely due to the report coming out after close in Taiwan. CPI came it at 0.1% over estimate and there was a big overreaction in pretty much every sector. Since this is such a small gap, I don‚Äôt think the dip will last long, and I am still bullish for earnings.

Just like on WSB, there are some topics we just can‚Äôt touch even though it‚Äôs pretty obvious why the jobs report came in smashing estimates.

And for that reason alone, the market responded positively since everyone took out their calculators and backed out one statistic to arrive at the true jobs report out. 

One other thing to consider over the weekend is the alarm bell the United Way is sounding in regards to poverty lines that haven‚Äôt moved much since 2010. This population is called ALICE and increased 18% from 2010 to 36 million people in 2021. They haven‚Äôt reported an update since, which is huge red flag. So you know those numbers are now jacked to the tits.

This is a data set that predicted the subprime mortgage crisis, baby formula shortage and now they are saying there is a big fucking problem. 

So the debate is whether or not that actually matters for the stock market.

Even though it sucks ass, I still think we ride. The biggest returns are missed when you sit on the sidelines with somebody else‚Äôs shlong in your hand trying to time bottoms. 

Plus if you aren‚Äôt bullish on the solar eclipse you can fuck off right back to your shitty planet Nibiru. If you need gold hit up Peter Schiff.

1084,Ramblings of a Remora: The size of the future AI market is truly hard to fathom and it's impact hard to imagine.,wallstreetbets,Nvidia,8,14,05-04-2024 18:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwpl5n/ramblings_of_a_remora_the_size_of_the_future_ai/,"It begins as a ""tool"", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

I believe AMD will underperform the market which has room to run, but there are better players. 

AMD's stock has experienced an 8% decline, fueled by speculation ""something"" happened in the middle-east (Iran saber rattling) or something else (interest rate cuts may not happen).  If you had shorted the stock, congratulations.  If you are long, read on.

Reality is these were excuses.  This is a risk off play, but also a move away from non-value that AMD represents at the current buy price.  AMD's been going higher surrounding its potential to produce groundbreaking AI chips. However, this optimism appears to be misplaced for a few reasons. Firstly, AMD's so-called AI chips have not been widely adopted by users, casting doubt on their significance. Secondly, even if AMD manages to make notable strides in AI, NVIDIA could simply respond by lowering prices, nullifying AMD's potential advantage.

On the computing chip front, AMD finds itself engaged in a fierce competition with Intel. Although it has managed to capture a portion of the market share, it still trails significantly behind its rival (sure it's taking some server share, but at what margins?). The prospect of AMD leveraging Microsoft's heavily marketed ""copilot computers"" seems to be the company's primary play, but this alone is unlikely to justify the lofty valuations it currently commands.

Given these considerations, it may be prudent for investors holding AMD stocks to use tomorrow's ""dead cat bounce (if it comes),"" and exit their positions. The risks associated with AMD's current trajectory appear to outweigh the potential rewards, at least in the near term.

Take your money and run.  AMD is not a great buy.

PS - based on comments a lot of folks lost money in AMD today and I am sorry about that.  Take my advice and don't lose the rest as it declines further from here. It has another 15-20% to go."

Basically the numbers were a lot worse than I expected, I lost another even more substantial portion of my life savings in a few hours on my calls so I stayed up late looking for Copium. I would like to be brutally honest and serious here. Trigger warning for the next part because first I need to get real.¬†¬†

The bad news is that net revenue was down 12% probably on lower margins as vehicle sales remain constant as it seems they are struggling to clear glut of inventory however declining market share in North America and Europe seems to have stabilized. Part of my Thesis was the fact that while EV sales have slumped a little their ICE business was an underestimated solid cash printing machine with high margins for the next few years however it seems they have been affected by malicious negative consumer sentiment. I read online that Stellantis vehicles are the worst shit, overpriced, outdated and very unreliable (FIAT is apparanty now an acronym that means ‚Äòfix it again Tony‚Äô) and insiders say they are failing to invest in expensive next gen motor technology, staff morale is appalling and quality control issues so maybe that is catching up with them however most of this was on reddit and reddit has an American bias although North America is still where they earn about 50% of their profit and is declining. Apart from that the few sales they had in China have all but collapsed down 50%, South America where they had strong growth reversed and the luxury division (Maeserati) performance also collapsed.¬† They also performed a lot worse than closest european competitor Volkswagen  did in Q1 which is trading on similar multiples

When I am down and unsure of myself I start to write a story so bullish that I start to believe in myself again. Despite the problems I still believe my $25 Jan 2026 calls are  going to print because BEV sales are up 8% and as the press release says they have 25 new models including 18 new BEV models ¬†planned for this year of which they have only released 4 so far. This is only the start of the ramp up towards their [Dare Forward 2030 Strategic Plan](https://www.stellantis.com/en/company/dare-forward-2030) in which they plan to reach 100% BEV Sales in Europe and 50% BEV sales in Europe by 2030. They are the only ‚ÄòLegacy‚Äô auto manufacturer to earn positive margins on EVs so far and will use their dying legacy auto business to finance this huge ramp up and become a profitable EV company. They say 800 km of range, yes 800 for their new models and ultra fast charging.¬†Furthermore they have great eurpoor subdies in France and pressuring Italy to do the same or they will move production to France. If someone doesn't believe Stellantis will become a profitable EV manufacturer in the next decade they should not be an investor in the company.  "

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE.

The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs).

1092,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,O'Reilly Auto Parts,200,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

1093,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,O'Reilly Auto Parts,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

1095,SMTC  | Paul Pickle did NOT forget about the doubters. ( +400% ü•í ) ,wallstreetbets,ON Semiconductor,25,10,03-05-2024 00:24:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1civ9t7/smtc_paul_pickle_did_not_forget_about_the/,"Two months ago, I decided to write my first ever reddit post about my DD into a small underrated semiconductor company with a badass CEO named Mr. Pickle ü•í to see what peoples opinions on the future of the stock would be, specifically for the upcoming Q4'23 earnings report.   
  
**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

https://preview.redd.it/2t8w8lxqt3yc1.png?width=671&format=png&auto=webp&s=adb83733453c9f2abaac5738615e35ea77939b3d

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology & data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

SMCI and AMD‚Äôs failure to perform will continue to bring the semiconductor market down tomorrow. The only reason why the burn was offset was due to Papa Powell giving the bulls a nice massage in the form of market calming. Every single serious question he was asked he deflected with ‚Äúwe gotta wait for the data‚Äù. The thing is people are catching on to this and the market is now pricing one or less rate cuts which will lead to a bearish week and decline going forward 

2. The supply chain constraints that SCMI and AMD attributed to their less than stellar results are the same issues that NVDA will have been facing when they report their results. Ergo they will miss either revenue, eps, or guidance going forward 

3. Aside from Apple earnings there are no more positive events coming up that can justify the hype carrying the stock

4. I bought calls

1097,Investing Pivot,wallstreetbets,ON Semiconductor,42,33,27-04-2024 20:26:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ceo2kh/investing_pivot/,"I've been an active investor in ETFs and individual stocks since graduating college in 2010. I've tried a little bit of everything and learned a lot (from good investments and some really bad ones) along the way. I've done broad market ETFs, sector ETFs, leveraged ETFs, commodity ETNs, penny stocks, risky biotech stocks that \*might\* go to the moon but will probably get pink slipped, solid large cap stocks, memestocks, option spreads, option calls and puts. etc... It's been a wild ride and I've learned a lot. While I made a lot of bad investments, I am grateful that I didn't do anything too reckless and only gambled a little bit of my money on insane ideas.

Overall my portfolio has done well in the past 14 years so I feel like I made money while going to school. I made a few really good large investments in large cap ETFs and a few companies that have done extremely well (NVDA, ANET, META, CYBR, BRK/B) But now it's time to simplify.

Now I am applying all those lessons learned to update my portfolio holdings to just the ETFs and companies I believe in for the long term. At the end of last year I had a lot of random little investments in all kinds of companies and ETFs and it was just ridiculous. Over 60 individual company stocks and dozens of different ETFs. I took diversification to an extreme that just wasn't making a difference and holding me back due to opportunity cost.

What I'm looking to do now is to sell off all the random ETFs and stocks that aren't my top picks. The famous saying from Warren Buffet about diversification I believe holds true about ETFs as well as individual companies. ""*If you can identify six wonderful businesses, that is all the diversification you need. And you will make a lot of money. And I can guarantee that going into a seventh one instead of putting more money into your first one is gotta be terrible mistake. Very few people have gotten rich on their seventh best idea. But a lot of people have gotten rich with their best idea.""*

Now I'm not nearly as good at evaluating companies as Warren Buffett. So my approach will be to identify my shortlist of favorite ETFs for long term growth as well as a few high conviction companies. I will consolidate my holdings into just these etfs / stocks.

I've done a lot of research this is where I've landed. I will rebalance as needed to make sure i don't get overly concentrated.

Large Cap US S&P 500: VOO / SPLG

Dividend Growth: VIG

Large Cap Growth: SCHG

Mid Cap Growth: IMCG

Mid Cap Value: COWZ

Small Cap Value: CALF

Semiconductors: SMH

I'm also experimenting a little with GPIQ and SPHY for yield, but I'm more focused on growth than yield at this point.

As for individual stocks, my key holdings are:

NVDA

META

GOOG

BRK.B

TSLA

CYBR

ANET

AVGO

MSFT

AMZN

PLTR

I realize this is very large cap growth / tech stock heavy... especially with some of my stock holdings also representing a significant weighting in the ETFs. But I am ok with this.I'm done with ETFs for REITS, Emerging Markets, International. In both good and bad economic environments since 2010 they don't typically provide outperformance and I would have been way better off just putting the money into a US S&P500 fund. I don't see any compelling reason to keep any money in these kind of funds anymore.I was looking for potential exposure to more small caps (esp growth) but I haven't found an ETF that is all that compelling in this space.

Curious what feedback people have. Is there something big I'm missing by avoiding International and REITs? Am I too concentrated in large cap tech? Am I leaning way too much on good past performance of large caps? Are there any fantastic ETFs I should considering adding to my short list?

For years I tried to buy beat up sectors and stocks hoping they would outperform, but I've seen just the opposite. So my strategy now is to stay relatively diversified into ETFs / companies that have a history of consistent strong performance and strong business models."

Both stocks and all semiconductor stocks are down bigly suddenly in last 25-30 minutes.

So, what happened?

I heard on CNBC that ASML, the Dutch semiconductor maker missed the earnings because of order slowdown from Samsung and TSMC. The ASML stock crashed and went down $67 or about 7%. And, almost all semiconductor stocks including NVDA, SMCI, AMAT etc went down about 2-3% in sympathy.

IMO, this is overreaction and has nothing to do with NVDA and SMCI. Being a risk taker, I just bought lot of ITM calls when NVDA was down at $862 and SMCI at $974. I think, both should recover provided no other bad news comes!

1102,"DD: ""ADEA"", a sleeping giant chip designer currently toying with the big dogs.",wallstreetbets,ON Semiconductor,538,244,04-04-2024 15:22:56,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvpxr3/dd_adea_a_sleeping_giant_chip_designer_currently/,"Hello, fellow regards. I'm going to be completely transparent here... I actually paid someone on a contracting website to find me undervalued publicly traded companies. (didn't cost too much). Of all the companies I was provided, this one stuck out like a sore thumb.  


The potential for a buyout is HUGE. In for $15 9/20 calls. I know I'm a chump for paying for this, but whatever here we go...

Here are the two reports I was given on ADEIA:

‚Äã

# Report 1 (Financials) 

Adeia, a company operating in the media and semiconductor intellectual property licensing sectors, has been active in forging significant deals and renewing licenses with major industry players. The company has reported strong financial results, with over $100 million in revenue, and [has successfully renewed intellectual property license agreements with giants like Samsung for mobile devices](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/adea/). This indicates a robust operational foundation and a promising outlook on its ability to generate revenue through its intellectual property portfolio.

Financially, Adeia has shown commendable performance. With a net margin of 17.33% and a pretax margin of 20.57%, the company's profitability ratios look strong. Furthermore, Adeia boasts a return on equity of 42.74% and a return on assets of 12.77%, indicating efficient use of shareholder equity and company assets. [The debt-to-equity ratio stands at 1.46, paired with a healthy current ratio of 2.02, suggesting a stable financial position with respect to short-term obligations](https://www.marketbeat.com/stocks/NASDAQ/ADEA/).

The valuation metrics provide a mixed bag. Adeia‚Äôs trailing PE ratio is 18.19, and its forward PE ratio significantly drops to 8.19, hinting at an anticipated increase in earnings. Additionally, with a beta of 1.14, Adeia's stock is slightly more volatile than the market, yet it has seen a 29.99% increase in price over the last 52 weeks. Analysts predict an average stock price target of $15.50 in the next year, suggesting a potential upside of 44.9% from its current price.

On the flip side, it's worth noting the company's market cap growth has been quite volatile, with significant fluctuations observed over recent periods. Such volatility may indicate a degree of market uncertainty or sector-specific risks that potential investors should be aware of.

Given its robust licensing strategy, strong financial performance, and positive analyst outlook, Adeia Inc. seems poised for growth. However, the inherent market and operational risks, reflected through its stock price volatility and market cap fluctuations, suggest a cautious approach. If you're considering an investment, it might be wise to keep a close eye on the company's ongoing developments and sector trends. Based on the data, Adeia seems to have the potential for a favorable return over a year's time, especially for investors with an appetite for a moderate level of risk and a keen eye on the tech and media sectors.

# Report 2 (Tech/News/Financials) 

Based on the research conducted, Adeia Inc. (ADEA) has been identified as an undervalued tech stock that is not widely discussed. The company's low P/E ratio of 10.72 and the interest of 16 hedge fund investors in Q2 2023 suggest that it may be undervalued by the market. The original prediction is that Adeia Inc. could experience growth in its stock value due to a market correction as investors recognize the company's value relative to its earnings, as well as the overall positive sentiment towards the tech sector. The detailed analysis for Adeia Inc. being undervalued includes its favorable P/E ratio, institutional confidence, strong performance of the tech sector, and the pivot towards AI and digitization. However, investors should conduct their own due diligence and consider the inherent volatility of tech stocks before making investment decisions.

Adeia Inc. has indeed made a significant breakthrough that might have not caught widespread attention yet. During the Chiplet Summit 2024, held from February 6 to 8 at the Santa Clara Convention Center, Adeia showcased its hybrid bonding technology. This technology is highlighted as a key enabler for next-generation high-performance semiconductor devices. By allowing the disaggregation of memory arrays and logic circuitry, hybrid bonding paves the way for the creation of new chiplet architectures.

1103,Earthquake in Taiwan may increase profitability for chipmakers,wallstreetbets,ON Semiconductor,32,27,04-04-2024 06:44:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvgi4c/earthquake_in_taiwan_may_increase_profitability/,"TSMC seems to have come out pretty much unscathed from the earthquake except for slight damage to some equipment. Still, there are going to be delays as they return to full production.

This slight delay may actually be beneficial to them as supply-demand drive prices for chips higher especially with the huge demand for NVDIA's new Blackwell processors with the AI bubble in full swing.

With TSMC monthly revenue set to be published on the 10 Apr, most likely going to show yoy growth and earning on the 18 Apr where I doubt they will give a weak outlook for the year due to the crazy demand for AI processors; I think TSMC is gonna üöÄüöÄ. They are the major chip suppliers for NVDA and I don't think it will slow down, and this slight slowdown in production due to the earthquake will only increase profits (they are in the Goldilock zone of disasters).

What do you guys think? I'm still bullish and I'm thinking of getting some 150 calls especially if there is a slight pullback tomorrow due to market overreaction to the natural disasters (there was a 6.3 earthquake in Japan a few hours ago)

1104,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Packaging Corporation of America,125,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

1106,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,Packaging Corporation of America,649,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."

Yet another coronavirus ([animal origin to humans](https://theconversation.com/a-person-in-texas-caught-bird-flu-after-mixing-with-dairy-cattle-should-we-be-worried-227223)) that we know very little about and certainly not enough to stop it.

Current situation:

&#x200B;

[Bird flu in chickens](https://preview.redd.it/y6try66yhhtc1.jpg?width=2059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fadc612737765bc87b4d9e474816a898720a4d59)

The first map is meaningless. Everyone is going to hoard chicken, chicken nuggets and eggs but they're wasting their time.

When it comes to chicken, that industry can take a major hit, keep walking and laugh it off. The chicken and egg industry is impervious to issues. They have that shit on lock down.

When it comes to meat that you consume, it's down to ""egg to your plate"" in 28 days. If the birds weren't ""harvested"" at this point, their legs would snap under their own weight. They're fatter than ever but their bone structure hasn't changed to adapt to it.

When it comes to eggs, billions of chickens are laying them daily, at peak, every 16 hours. Eggs last forever, the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes, they grow faster than ever.

You can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.

# How do I know this?

3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.

The one that matters here is live chickens.

The highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.

Ever wonder what $8,200,000 worth of chickens look like?

Feast your eyes on this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3titj0f0khtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7baeb7d3894554dd278b29603db3347e1f2f9

8,200 chickens worth $1,000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn, 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them, I was escorted down the highway, blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16,500,000 worth of chickens, 4,500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.

(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist, supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)

These are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.

I've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10,000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather, it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there, they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).

# There won't be a shortage of chicken, meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.

&#x200B;

Let's discuss beef for a second.

Beef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also, of all the mafia ridden shit going, beef is definitely it.

There are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.

\- feminine hygiene products

\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)

\- frozen meat

&#x200B;

If they did, you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint, or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.

On the other hand, it's abundant. 

Being Canadian, we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;

\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022, Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))

\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada‚Äôs beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)

There is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef, 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.

Final point:

Who is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  
Brazil  
**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023, followed by India, which exports water buffalo, the United States and Australia. Mar 5, 2024

&#x200B;

# This is also not the play.

&#x200B;

Ok, so what is the play?

# MILK

&#x200B;

This shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.

You can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. 

The substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.

\- school milk programs

\- cheese production

\- butter

\- ice cream

\- yogurt

&#x200B;

You might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.

This is where you're wrong.

""In the barn"" means ""in the workers"".

The industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. 

Let's visualize that journey:

\- It starts at the feed mill.

\- Then it's a truck driver.

\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.

\- Another driver who collects the milk.

\- A dock worker.

\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.

\- Another truck driver.

\- The person stocking the shelves.

&#x200B;

Whether you realize it or not, that's 50+ people.

Thinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.

If a cow gets sick, they produce way less milk.

The following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while, she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse, the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.

[The last time this happened, they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)

&#x200B;

This should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.

&#x200B;

# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.

&#x200B;

Also... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?

1109,FTNT Results - buy ZS and CRWD,wallstreetbets,Palo Alto Networks,4,13,03-05-2024 13:31:42,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cj8rco/ftnt_results_buy_zs_and_crwd/,"ZS and CRWD are buys after FTNT's disappointing earnings

TL;DR: FTNT's shift towards SASE solutions at the expense of legacy firewalls bodes well for cloud security players like ZS and CRWD. I doubled down on ZS.

FTNT reported weak billings and highlighted their transformation towards becoming a major SASE (Secure Access Service Edge) player, moving away from traditional firewalls. While the market initially punished cybersecurity stocks, a deeper dive suggests this is actually good news for cloud-based security vendors.

The key takeaways:

* PANW: Neutral to Negative. Palo Alto still relies heavily on firewalls, so we can expect a poor quarter from them based on FTNT's results.
* ZS: Positive. The accelerating shift from firewalls directly benefits ZScaler's cloud security offerings. Despite potential share loss, ZS will grow rapidly in dollar terms. They've been aggressively building their sales force to capitalize on this trend. I'm doubling down - expecting ZS to hit $220 within a month and $350+ within a year.
* CRWD: Buy. While I believe ZS will outperform, CrowdStrike is still a solid buy given current tailwinds.

FTNT's pivot shows legacy firewall vendors losing ground to cloud security disruptors like ZS and CRWD. I took advantage of the dip to load up on ZS. Their future looks incredibly bright as secure cloud adoption continues accelerating.

  
PS: FTNT will be an amazing buy at $40. "

1112,Cybersecurity - buy the winners,wallstreetbets,Palo Alto Networks,58,38,09-04-2024 16:23:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzwbhj/cybersecurity_buy_the_winners/,"Cybersecurity remains one of the fastest growing industries. However, it is also a very fragmented space. After a big pullback due to Palo Alto Networks (PANW) reporting disappointing results, the whole sector took a dump and then has traded in a narrow range, trending down slightly in the last month. This has created an interesting buying opportunity, if you pick the right names.

First a little history lesson on PANW's earnings call that turned the tide. In its FY23 report, PANW unveiled a ""new platformization strategy"" - essentially bundling products, which is a trend we've seen across various industries (Progressive to FedEx). However, the results so far have been underwhelming with PANW seeing a significant decceleration. Then more recently in its Q2 results, PANW cited ""demand fatigue"" to justify a significant deceleration in its own product sales. This in turn had a negative impact on its cybersecurity peers.

The reality check:

1. The ""demand fatigue"" narrative was not borne out, as peers like ZS, CRWD continued to grow at 30%+ clip, while PANW guides for just 2-4% growth.
2. The price action initially was correlated, but has now started to diverge as active investors shift dollars from PANW to other players they believe will win. Given PANW's brand recognition, I suspect we'll see more allocation from sidelines than a shift from PANW.

Key names to consider:

1. CRWD: Crowded trade, higher risk. Hold.
2. PANW: Thrown all the bad news, price action reversing. A ""must own"" cybersecurity stock, also bought by Nancy Pelosi. Buy.
3. ZS: Had a good but not great quarter. Historically, ZS beats sales by 5%, but the beat was only 3%. Stock has traded sideways, but on top of larger Fed deals, Zscaler is poised to recover towards $240 as it beats earnings. Hot buy.
4. FTNT: Appears cheap, but not in the same league. Sold off after a recent cyber event. Sell if you own it.

Overall, the cybersecurity space presents an interesting opportunity, but pick the right names. ZS is my top pick. PANW next.  Skip the rest."

I had to close out my calls. "
1114,PARA Thesis - No Deal and No Merger Outlook,wallstreetbets,Paramount Global,21,21,18-04-2024 21:08:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c7ep3z/para_thesis_no_deal_and_no_merger_outlook/,"This thesis builds on continued earnings growth from Q3 and Q4 of 2023. I am anticipating EPS of between $0.75 and $1.00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024. I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect, Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x, while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions, I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line, a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I‚Äôm fairly confident the Skydance deal won‚Äôt be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this,

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall, bullish on Paramount. I think it‚Äôs trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects, David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He‚Äôs also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised, but in my opinion, if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues, would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two, the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall, I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense. It‚Äôs a dramatic story if you have been paying attention. "

In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "

Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

Based on the graph you provided showing Exchange Normalized Trade Volume and the context of recent events, here's a bullish thesis for Coinbase regarding their upcoming Q1 earnings report:

### Coinbase Bull Thesis for Q1 Earnings Report

#### 1. **Increased Trading Volume and Revenue**
   - The graph indicates significant spikes in trading volume from January to March 2024. These periods of high trading volume are critical because they directly correlate with increased transaction fees, which are a primary revenue source for Coinbase. Given the substantial peaks, especially in February and March, Coinbase's revenue from trading fees is likely to have seen considerable growth in Q1.

#### 2. **Introduction of ETFs and Management Role**
   - The introduction of cryptocurrency-related ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) during this quarter, with Coinbase reportedly managing most of them, presents a significant growth opportunity. ETFs attract both retail and institutional investors, broadening Coinbase's customer base. Management of these ETFs not only generates management fees but also boosts trading volumes on the platform, further increasing transaction-based revenues.

#### 3. **Market Sentiment and Adoption**
   - The heightened activity and spikes in the normalized trade volume suggest increased market adoption and interest in cryptocurrencies. As a leading platform, Coinbase benefits from higher overall market sentiment, attracting new users and retaining existing ones. This trend is likely to have contributed positively to their Q1 earnings through expanded user growth and associated service fees.

#### 4. **Diversification and Innovation**
   - Coinbase has been diversifying its product offerings, including staking, custody services, and institutional investment solutions. These services contribute to a more stable revenue stream, balancing the volatility of transaction fees. The introduction and management of ETFs are part of this strategic diversification, likely enhancing the company's financial stability and attractiveness to investors.

#### 5. **Regulatory and Strategic Positioning**
   - Amidst increasing discussions around cryptocurrency regulations, Coinbase's proactive approach to compliance and its established position as a regulated entity in various jurisdictions could be seen as a competitive advantage. This positioning reassures investors and users, potentially increasing the platform‚Äôs trustworthiness and user base, further impacting its Q1 performance positively.

#### 6. **Broader Economic Indicators**
   - The overall increase in digital asset trading volumes across various exchanges, as seen in the provided chart, suggests a robust period for the crypto market. As one of the leading exchanges, Coinbase is likely to have capitalized on this trend, enhancing its market share and revenue during this period.

### Conclusion
Coinbase's Q1 earnings are positioned to reflect a strong quarter, driven by increased trading volumes, the successful introduction and management of new ETF products, strategic market positioning, and a broadening of its financial services. Investors may look forward to a positive earnings report, underscoring the company's resilience and adaptability in a dynamic market environment."

Ouch. See my original post for ‚Äòinvestment thesis.‚Äô
I‚Äôm still holding though, I didn‚Äôt full YOLO to 0dtes or weeklies on purpose here. Figured we might get some wild reaction like this. I think we see a rebound this week after earnings is digested and potentially getting more coverage.

Coming from my FinTech experience, this is what I really honed in on during the CNBC interview, when Sara asked about the tech platform:

Noto:
...on the tech platform, it grew 21% year over year on a revenue basis, which is an acceleration compared to the last 2 quarters. Our strength there is that SoFi is a one-stop shop for all your digital financial services needs and because we are a one-stop shop, we have greater demands on technology innovation. The ability to use data, the ability to integrate on personalization capabilities, fraud protection capabilities, and because SoFi needs all those technologies, we‚Äôre building the cutting edge technologies, things like a Gen 3 Core and payment processing and issuing. And because we need those things and we‚Äôre the leader, the only company providing a full one-stop shop for digital financial services, we‚Äôre building technologies that will benefit everyone else, and we‚Äôre turning that into a business, just like Amazon did with AWS.

I‚Äôve worked in Big Tech and FinTech, and think SoFi has a good shot at differentiating their offerings in the FinTech sector and recognizing a higher valuation, as they grow their technology offerings. 

Specifically watching Galileo and Technisys. When you talk platforms and banking cores, it‚Äôs easy to lose people, but this is where the wonder of finance happens.

Outside of that, the continued cross selling of services will be important and lowered customer acquisition costs, which I think is doable.

1129,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,PNC Financial Services,196,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"

1132,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,wallstreetbets,PNC Financial Services,0,125,12-04-2024 14:19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ad4f/gopro_is_ridiculously_cheap_fundamentally/,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives."

Brief dd since detailed ones turn stocks upside down:

* Achieved first profitable quartet last earnings report, has consistently beat earnings expectations for multiple quarters, and SOFI historically has a delayed upward bounce after earnings beats
* Recently oversold due to complex financial changes / maneuvering
* Several fundamental investment firms value the stock much higher (""fair value"" is around $11)
* Technically under 3 month moving averages, and edging to cross over ;)
* The stock bottomed for FY24 a couple months ago and is going up üöÄ pivot point?
* Also my portfolio created a ""W"" pattern after buying in, which is obviously a bull signal for upcoming ""Wins""
* This is my first time in $SOFI, so I'm not a bag holder, yet...

Come at me bro...earnings call set for 04/29/2024 pre-market.

p.s. how do you guys guess / tell when ppl use ChatGPT?

1134,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,PNC Financial Services,79,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

1. Competition, other insolvent banks could shed light on their insolvency
2. New regulations intended to prevent bank failures
3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid

Here is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:

  
They lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. ""Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December¬†31, 2023, and December¬†31, 2022, respectively.""

On competition:

""The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.""

... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...

Regulation

""Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.""

... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...

Them a bank and don't have money

""We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

I don't want to start a panic. If this bank doesn't fail, we are a lot more fucked than we think we are because it absolutely should. My price target is $.0001. I have the ""courage"" to buy every put you write me at $2.5 so let's do this.

Well‚Ä¶ let's just say investors ran to purchase some shares.¬†

**Background:** HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/hubspot-stock-jumps-amid-reports-google-parent-alphabet-considering-acquisition/ar-BB1l5hUX). The company provides businesses with marketing and customer service software.

**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.¬†

**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google‚Äôs ad business.
* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer.¬†

Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December[om here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)"

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

1144,Bitcoin Halving and the Brewing Storm in Crypto Mining: A Deep Dive,wallstreetbets,Principal Financial Group,28,38,18-04-2024 13:41:36,https://i.redd.it/bfq9lfppr8vc1.jpeg,"As most of you know, the Bitcoin halving is due in just a few days. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, is a built-in feature of Bitcoin that reduces the reward for mining new blocks in half. Currently, miners are rewarded 900 BTC per day, but post-halving, this will drop to 450 BTC. With Bitcoin's current valuation, this reward reduction could slash the industry's annual revenue by an estimated $10 billion. That's huge!

Previous halvings have historically led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin, which helped mitigate the reduced mining rewards. However, this time the context is different, and here‚Äôs why:

1. Increased Operational Costs: The mining difficulty has shot up nearly six times since the last halving, driven by a surge in the miner population chasing the same reward pie. Consequently, to stay competitive, miners are forced to invest in more expensive equipment, which is a hefty financial commitment.

2. Energy Cost Competition: Miners are also vying against deep-pocketed Big Tech firms for affordable electricity. These firms are investing heavily in AI and data centers, and utility companies prefer them over crypto miners for their stable financial outlook, leaving miners with higher electricity costs.

Now, here's the kicker. The increased skepticism around the profitability of crypto mining has led traders to place significant short bets against crypto mining stocks. Last I checked, the total short interest for a group of 15 crypto-mining stocks is hovering around $2 billion, representing almost 15% of these companies' available shares. To put that into perspective, it's three times the US market average short interest.

The market seems to be signaling a lack of confidence in the mining industry's ability to cope with the halving and rising operational costs. We're looking at a potential violent move up or a downturn in mining stocks, depending on how the situation unfolds.

1146,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,wallstreetbets,Principal Financial Group,2242,434,15-04-2024 19:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4uddl/donald_trump_is_taking_his_of_djt_todays_resale/,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, chair of the Zodiac Group, which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer, the owner of the Zodiac group, at $24 billion, making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war,‚Äù said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

https://www.nytimes.com/2024/04/12/world/middleeast/iran-israel-miscalculation-retaliation.html


No direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?

Regardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran‚Äôs best interest to keep oil prices elevated."

(NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,Principal Financial Group,22,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

1. Competition, other insolvent banks could shed light on their insolvency
2. New regulations intended to prevent bank failures
3. The value of their assets is overstated because they are not liquid

Here is data corresponding to each of these reports directly from their own 10-K:

  
They lost 30% of their allowances for credit losses. ""Our allowance for credit losses coverage ratio of non-performing loans was 1,044.69% and 1,409.16% at December¬†31, 2023, and December¬†31, 2022, respectively.""

On competition:

""The soundness of other financial institutions could adversely affect us.Our ability to engage in routine funding transactions could be adversely affected by the actions and commercial soundness of other financial institutions. Financial services institutions are interrelated as a result of trading, clearing, counterparty and other relationships. We have exposure to many different industries and counterparties, and we routinely execute transactions with counterparties in the financial industry. As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us. There is no assurance that any such losses would not adversely affect us and possibly be material in nature.""

... What a crazy thing to report as a bank ...

Regulation

""Changes in regulation or oversight may have a material adverse impact on our operations.We are subject to extensive regulation, supervision and examination by the Federal Reserve, the FDIC, the Michigan DIFS, the SEC and other regulatory bodies. Such regulation and supervision govern the activities in which we may engage. Regulatory authorities have extensive discretion in their supervisory and enforcement activities, including the imposition of restrictions on our operations, limitations related to our securities, the classification of our assets, and the determination of the level of our allowance for credit losses. Any change in such regulation and oversight, whether in the form of regulatory policy, regulations, legislation or supervisory action, may have a material adverse impact on our business, financial condition or results of operations.Additional regulatory focus on the financial services industry is common in connection with an economic downturn, as the industry experienced following the most recent financial crisis. As a result, the adverse effects on our business relating to a future economic downturn could be exacerbated by additional regulations and regulatory scrutiny that accompanied or followed any such downturn. We can neither predict when or whether future regulatory or legislative reforms will be enacted nor what their contents will be. The impact of any future legislation or regulatory actions on our businesses or operations cannot be determined at this time, and such impact may adversely affect us.""

... That makes sense but oh well, not risking my savings. Well, I kinda am cuz I moved it to naked puts ...

Them a bank and don't have money

""We are subject to liquidity risk in our operations, which could adversely impact our ability to fund various obligations.Liquidity risk is the possibility of being unable to meet obligations as they come due or capitalize on growth opportunities as they arise because of an inability to liquidate assets or obtain adequate funding on a timely basis, at a reasonable cost and within acceptable risk tolerances. Liquidity is required to fund various obligations, including credit obligations to borrowers, loan originations, withdrawals by depositors, repayment of debt, dividends to shareholders, operating expenses and capital expenditures. Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

I don't want to start a panic. If this bank doesn't fail, we are a lot more fucked than we think we are because it absolutely should. My price target is $.0001. I have the ""courage"" to buy every put you write me at $2.5 so let's do this.

However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

But you should grab some tendies and a brewski, pop a zynny in your upper deck and lets hop into this.

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

Let‚Äôs start with the bad, the kind of really bad. However, we will show you why it doesn‚Äôt matter much towards the end. But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)).

[**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù.

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it.

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

1156,"TLT, Boomer YOLO.",wallstreetbets,Procter & Gamble,23,75,12-04-2024 18:32:28,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2gl8u/tlt_boomer_yolo/,"This is kinda boomer YOLO, but literally free money, and won't go tits up.

I am a cuck pussy, so I can't go full regard like rest of you beautiful autists. I got plenty mouths to feed, kids, wife and her boyfriend and his mistress and so forth. so I have to play conservative.



Why TLT? Here's my reasoning:

- TLT is giving yield at 4% ish now. About $700 bucks a month, so monthly coupon divvy provides continuous fund to gamble on SPY/SPX option

- TLT will not go tits up. Well, if TLT does go tits up, we got bigger problem then our fake monopoly money

- Nobody know what the rate will be in the short term. But I think it is more probable that rate will come down eventually in the long run. I am long term investor.

- JPOW is fast & furious man. Look at his history, taper tantrum, COVID cut. He cuts fast, raises fast. Faster than you can fap on your wife fucking her boyfriend. So when he cut, he will cut bigly.



Price Target

- Market fear & vol could drive TLT down to $80 ish. That's 12% drawdown, I am comfortable with that. It's called defined risk. Also I can numb my feeling by keep gambling with TLT divvy.

- When JPOW did cut the rate in the past, TLT went to $140+ Thus $140 is minimum target.

- If reason for the cut is some sort of doomsday FUD, then it could go to $160+

- Estimated profit at exit is $120K \~ $168K

Best part of this is that if I make money, I still don't pay any CAP gain tax, because I have abundance of cap loss carryover from my old heavy bags on different loss.

Defined smol risk, higher upside & probability. It would be foolish to not to take this trade.

  
Edit: Position, 2400 shares of TLT

In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "
1159,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,Public Service Enterprise Group,57,35,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

1160,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,Public Service Enterprise Group,261,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

1162,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Public Service Enterprise Group,203,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"

1165,Donald Trump is taking his $ of DJT - today's resale registration is our ~30 day warning,wallstreetbets,Public Service Enterprise Group,2234,434,15-04-2024 19:00:38,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4uddl/donald_trump_is_taking_his_of_djt_todays_resale/,"\*\*Background\*\*

I was looking into resale registrations, one of which was contained in this mornings DJT S-1 filling where they diluted the stock 15%, here: [https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1\_s1.htm](https://www.sec.gov/ix?doc=/Archives/edgar/data/1849635/000114036124019745/ny20026576x1_s1.htm)

Why would one file a resale registration? Well, on Truth Social they are eagerly sharing a quote from the Reuters article where a lawyer says ""it's completely normal to put that up for your stockholders.""

TS post: [https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170](https://truthsocial.com/group/dwac/posts/112276002659745170)

So, obviously it's not that.

\*\*Theory\*\*

Why else, then, would the company file a resale registration? It could be because DJT previously did a PIPE and now intends to sell his shares - aka a Private Investment in Public Equity. SEC explainer: [https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25\_2006/pinedo\_tanenbaum\_pipefaq.pdf](https://www.sec.gov/info/smallbus/gbfor25_2006/pinedo_tanenbaum_pipefaq.pdf)

But why would Donald Trump put MORE money into his failing business?

Answer: He's not, he's extracting his $$$ through the abuse of an otherwise common financial instrument.

FIRST - Trump agrees to purchase some large number of additional shares for a ludicrously low price. 

""But blackout periods for selling PIPE shares!"" > at the discretion of the issuer

""But never agree to low price / it's fraud!"" > price solely agreed between investor and issuer. He could even choose a variable price, like ""50% of the current value of shares.""

""But PIPE shares are legended! Rule 144!"" > Only before the the resale registration becomes effective, Afterwards, sell away.

""But you'd have to say something to someone!"" > They just did, and afaik the only two reporting requirements are to say what shares are up for resale and who the Shareholders are (did it).

SECOND - Wait 30 days for the resale registration to complete at the SEC, using the dilution component of the S-1 as a red herring to keep people off the scent of the real scam.

THIRD - slide all those PIPE purchased, cheap ass shares into the market all stealthy like. His other 150 million shares go to zero but (1) they only existed so he could use his control of the company to abuse PIPEs (2) zero was going to happen anyways.

\*\*Trading hypothesis\*\*

DJT falls faster than any institutional investor expects because Trump uses norms built into standard practices to supercharge his scams. Evidence: his entire presidency & post-presidency and all the pathetic ""but norms"" hand waving by the political class. No exceptions made for institutional investor class, sorry.

DJT cultists catch the falling knife as usual.

\*\*Positions\*\*

$3k in Puts at price points between $25 and $5 over the next 8 months.

Litigation- The FTC wants to tighten an existing 2020 Facebook privacy settlement to ban profiting from minors' data and expand curbs on facial recognition technology. The agency has accused Meta of misleading parents about protections for children. The FTC also wants undo the acquisitions of Instagram and WhatsApp, claiming Meta illegally maintains a monopoly in ‚Äúpersonal social networking‚Äù. If these go through it will be a massive blow to the bottom line. Twitter is also suing Meta claiming Threads copied their business and trade secret theft, we'll see how this plays out. Lets also mention the never ending regulatory fines and litigation with European agencies.  All these issues are a serious liability for the company.

The competition- The single biggest threat to Meta is TikTok. The reason they are lobbying so hard to get it banned. People migrate to the next big thing, older generations dont like change so i fully expect them to stay with Facebook until the end but the smart money saw whats happening with TikTok, how fast its taken over the younger generation and they want it, all of it. Steven Mnuchin is a smart man, he knows at the current rate of TikToks growth its going to overtake Facebook and Instagram within the next 2-3 years. Its in a hyper growth stage and Meta has simply stalled out.

TikTok is also launching a direct competitor to Instagram and WhatsApp, very soon. Those users 35 and under  currently on Insta will easily migrate over to the newest thing. There is no loyalty to a service or app. If you are spending most of your time already watching tiktok, you can easily switch over to Notes, no need to go back to Instagram if all your friend are posting videos,pictures and chatting on TikTok. More time spent on Tiktok, less time on Meta apps.

The presidential election- The Presidential ad spending is always massive and grows each year but its very limited. Only 28.1 percent goes to digital marketing, most goes toward tv ads not small facebook, google and newspaper ads.

AI - Meta announced their AI plans even making their own chips, or designing their own chips. This seems like a last ditch effort to stay relevant and a costly venture like the metaverse. I don't see what meta could do with AI other than mine peoples data more efficiently and sell it. Picture and video AI is limited, there's so many third party apps that can do it better. 

Meta is running out of ideas, the company has peaked, we may start to see declining revenue and user activity year after year. The balance of influence is shifting. Meta had its run, time to join Myspace. 

lastly the dividend, another effort to keep investors around. You can get a higher yield and take less risk holding a treasury bond. "

1168,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,Public Service Enterprise Group,59,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

Drugs don't count, although probably your dealer asked you to CashApp him/her. It doesn't matter if you're a luxury retailer, or a mom and pop shop, you probably have seen the Square terminals everywhere you go. They're going even further to integrate, that lots of restaurants just hand you your check with a QR code for payment.... with you guessed it, powered by Block. To be honest, I don't even carry my wallet with me anymore. My phone does everything -- unlocks my car, pays for stuff, etc. Block hit over $275 during COVID because people didn't want to handle cash! We are trending in that direction anyway.

Management: Now that Dorsey's back, he's laser focused both on improving expenses (think ""year of efficiency"" a la Zuckerberg) and  ongrowing Square terminals and having cashapp be the de-facto way to transfer cash/crypto between people. Venmo is good, but it doesn't have vertical integration.

**Grupo Aeropuerto Del Pacifico (PAC):** Thesis: This one was a weird one I stumbled across. I follow many influencers and the hot place to go to these days seem to be Tulum, Cancun, Cabo, Puerto Vallarta. What do these things all have in common? They're owned by this publicly traded company! I decided to take a trip with my buddies to see what the hype was about. I was blown away. Food, 5 star hotels, amazing weather, hot latinas, private beach cabana, bottle service, all for a THIRD of the price of what you'd get in the USA! No wonder these influencers are able to afford this -- wintering/summering in the Hamptons or Miami (or really, anywhere in the USA) are for chumps these days. Their 2nd biggest airport, Tijuana International, just got a 100m joint USA-MEX investment, and I tell you, looks amazing. I'm really glad they took the time during COVID to expand, because these airports (at least CUN which I just got back last week) was packed to the hilt. Americans and Mexicans everywhere. (Recession? What recession?)

Management are really good at issuing a healthy dividend and re-investing money back into expansion, so I really believe in them.

  
Positions: Just stock. I don't know the timeline enough to play options, all I know is that it's long term consistent (and boring at times) growth.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific‚Äôs #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.

Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)).

1176,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Public Storage,43,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

Continuing the search for more insights into the current Semiconductor market, as posted in an earlier [Reddit-post](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0fhna/semiconductor_titans_visualized_a_chain_of/), I have come across an interested article with a more detailed breakdown from November last year.

1179,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Ralph Lauren Corporation,129,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

1181,Enovix corp (ENVX),wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,126,140,26-04-2024 09:03:09,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdgo4v/enovix_corp_envx/,"Energy materials scientist here. I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.

# TL;DR:

Enovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.

# Financials and stonk mommy moves:

* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say ""bankruptcy,"" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.
* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.
* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.
* **Manufacturing muscle**: They‚Äôre expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.
* **Strategic alliances**: They‚Äôve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.

# Tech specs and market hype:

* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.
* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there‚Äôs a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.

# Bottom Line:

Enovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It‚Äôs a textbook high-risk, high-reward play. They could be the garden gnome that wins the Iron Throne that tech investors have been praying for to lead the next big wave in battery technology. Or, they could go down in flames as a cautionary tale of overreach and under-delivery. Personally, I'm bullish and have shares and calls.

This is not financial advice -- I am only a primate in the sense that I boof bananas."
1182,IS ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL?,wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,8,39,24-04-2024 20:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc982d/is_anyone_actually_bullish_about_ccl/,"Is anyone bullish about $CCL??? Honestly, take a look at the fundamentals, the bottom and top lines, and consider its potential for growth.

(Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = üöÄ potential.

Loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of 100+ ships.

Long-term play, potential 5x-10x return.)

I'm bullish about $CCL, and here's why:

First, let's take a look at the fundamentals. Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company, with a market cap of approximately $18.79 billion as of April 24, 2024. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78, indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity. Additionally, $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships, making it a major player in the cruise industry.

Now, let's consider the company's financial performance. In 2023, $CCL reported revenue of $24.5 billion, a significant increase from the $5.6 billion it reported in 2022. This indicates that the travel demand is surging, and $CCL is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

Moreover, $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4, compared to the industry average of 15. This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth.

The company's history also supports a bullish outlook. Before the pandemic, $CCL was a high-flying stock, with a P/E ratio of over 20. While the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, it has since recovered and is now back on track for growth.

Essentially, with a loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of over 100 ships, $CCL is a long-term play with the potential for a 5x-10x return. The surge in travel demand and the company's undervalued stock price make it an attractive investment opportunity."

1184,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,124,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
1186,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,214,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

1190,üöÄ Discussion on Proximus (EBR: PROX): Dominating Belgium's rational Telecom Oligopoly üöÄ,wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,9,10,13-04-2024 11:39:58,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2zx7i/discussion_on_proximus_ebr_prox_dominating/," 

I've got a hot tip for you all that's hotter than a freshly grilled tendie: Proximus (EBR: PROX).

Now, I know what you're thinking, ""Why should I care about some boring telecom company?"" Well, let me tell you, Proximus is not your average telecom stock.

First off, let's talk about their market dominance. Proximus essentially owns the Walloon market in Belgium, while Telenet serves Flanders. It's like they're playing a game of Monopoly, and they've got the Walloon region locked down. This oligopoly status means stable cash flows and minimal competition‚Äîa dream scenario for investors.

But that's not all. Proximus is not resting on its laurels; it's investing heavily in the future. They're currently pouring money into installing fiber optics across Belgium. This move is genius‚Äîit not only future-proofs their infrastructure but also sets them up for massive returns down the line. And you know what that means for us YOLOers‚Äîmore tendies!

And let's talk dividends, shall we? Proximus is currently offering a dividend yield of a jaw-dropping 18%. Yes, you read that right, 18%! Now, I know what you're thinking, ""That's unsustainable, right?"" Wrong. Dead wrong. With Proximus' stable performance and dominant market position, I firmly believe these dividends can sustain at least a 10% yield for the foreseeable future.

So, fellow autists, it's time to YOLO on Proximus. Load up on those shares, sit back, and watch your portfolio grow while you enjoy those juicy dividend payouts.

Disclaimer: This is not financial advice. I'm just a smooth-brained ape like the rest of you. Do your own due diligence and always remember: üíéüôå

1191,GoPro is ridiculously cheap fundamentally. ,wallstreetbets,Regions Financial Corporation,1,125,12-04-2024 14:19:51,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ad4f/gopro_is_ridiculously_cheap_fundamentally/,"I think stock is should  atleast trade at 2-3x the current price.  Market cap is just 200 mil ? 

They have bought at least 40 mil in stocks in 2023. Are you kidding me?

Fundamental thesis: 
- Strategic Shift and Innovation: GoPro has evolved its business model from selling just hardware to combining hardware sales with subscription services and premium services launched in February 2024. This shift towards a more service-oriented model aims to provide a steady revenue stream and enhance customer loyalty.

- Financial Performance: GoPro has shown significant cash generation improvements over the years. For example, from an average cash usage of $46 million in the years before 2020, to generating $91 million and $221 million in subsequent years, although there was a slight dip to $2 million in cash generation in 2023. Despite this, GoPro managed to partially repay its convertible debt and repurchase $40 million in stock in 2023.

- Market Presence: GoPro has maintained its position as a leading brand in the U.S. camcorder market, with the HERO12 BLACK being the best-selling camera. The company boasts a strong social media presence with millions of followers and billions of lifetime views on its YouTube channel, indicating a robust market reach and brand recognition.

- Recent Acquisition: GoPro's acquisition of Forcite, aimed at enhancing the performance and safety of helmets, starting with motorcycle helmets, signals GoPro's intention to expand its market presence into new segments, leveraging its brand strength in motorsports and among motorcycle enthusiasts.

- Subscription Services Growth: The company has seen growth in its subscription services, with a notable increase in the average selling price (ASP) of its cameras and a compounded annual growth rate (CAGR) of 69% for its subscription services. The subscriber renewal rates show increasing loyalty, with more than 80% renewal rate by the third year.

- Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR): GoPro highlighted its commitment to CSR with initiatives like employee engagement, diversity, and sustainability goals. The company aims to source 100% renewable energy for its U.S. locations by 2026 and has disclosed its greenhouse gas emissions.

- Financial Highlights:  Revenue showed a slight decline in 2023 compared to previous years, but the adjusted EBITDA remained positive, indicating a healthy operational profit margin. There's also a notable shift in the MSRP camera revenue mix, with a higher percentage of cameras being sold at prices above $400 MSRP in 2023 compared to 2019.

Analyzing these points, GoPro's strategic focus on diversification through subscription services, its strong brand presence, and recent initiatives to penetrate new markets suggest a solid foundation for growth. While there was a dip in cash generation in 2023, GoPro's ability to maintain profitability and invest in strategic acquisitions and stock repurchases demonstrates financial resilience. Given this context, a market cap of $200 million might seem conservative, especially when considering the company's assets, equity, and strategic positioning for future growth. The information suggests that GoPro is actively working to expand and solidify its market presence, which could potentially increase its valuation in the eyes of investors looking beyond the immediate financial figures to the company's growth potential and strategic initiatives."

Well‚Ä¶ let's just say investors ran to purchase some shares.¬†

**Background:** HubSpot, based in Cambridge, Massachusetts, had a market cap of around $32 billion before the news was leaked by [Reuters](https://www.msn.com/en-us/money/technology/hubspot-stock-jumps-amid-reports-google-parent-alphabet-considering-acquisition/ar-BB1l5hUX).

**Company Synergies:** Many corporations track their SEO and Google Analytics data through HubSpot to see how well their site and the blogs or articles within it are performing over time, so the synergies are definitely present between the two companies.¬†

**Potential Implications:** Alphabet must be careful as it has faced some major antitrust scrutiny over the past year.

* The U.S. Department of Justice recently filed its second antitrust suit against Google‚Äôs ad business.
* The first antitrust lawsuit, filed in October 2020, accused Google of unlawfully obtaining a monopoly in the search market.

To make sure no antitrust issues come about this time around, Alphabet is making sure to consult with its financial partner, Morgan Stanley, first before making a potential offer.¬†

Under the Biden administration, technology conglomerates have found it difficult to pursue mega deals that could cause unfair monopolistic competitive advantages in the industry.

**Bottom line:** If the acquisition were to go through, it would be the largest in Alphabets history and allow for its mega pile of cash to be put to use, currently at $110.9 billion as of the end of December[om here](https://www.blackswanstreet.com/subscribe)"

RCL has nearly double the earnings/double the debt and 30% more shares. NCLH has 20% more earnings, double the debt and 2.3 more share out. CCL has the same earnings, triple the debt and double the shares outstanding.

**Royal Caribbean**: has a market cap of $37.4b an enterprise value of $59b or $140 a share. It projects to earn $11 (likely to beat). RCL had $11b of debt before COVID and $3.4b of EBITDA with $21.4b of debt. This year it should have $6.2b.

**Carnival:** has a market cap of $21b (using 1.4b share count), an enterprise value of $52b. It projects to earn 98 cents. CCL had $11.2b of debt before COVID and $5.6b of EBITDA. and $32b of debt

**NCLH**: has a market cap of $9.8b, and an enterprise value of $24b. It projects to earn $1.23 this year. NCLH had $6.8b of debt before covid and $1.8b of EBITDA. This year it has $14b of debt.

**Valuation Metrics**

RCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.5  
RCL: Current PE 11.67

CCL: Enterprise value to EBITDA of 9.3  
CCL: PE ratio of 15

NCLH Enterprise value to EBITDA of 10.9  
NCLH: 15.4 PE

The way valuation works is companies with less debt should have higher PE‚Äôs. RCL has better growth prospects then these companies and lowering its debt. I know people are confused because NCLH and CCL are still down a lot since COVID. But both companies have a lot more shares outstanding.

RCL has 280m diluted shares vs 209 pre covid  
CCL has 1.40 b shares vs. 686m shares pre-covid.  
NCLH now has 516m shares outstanding 224m shares outstanding

Starbucks was already in the Unfavored zone of the SIA S&P 100 Index Report and fell 7 more spots yesterday to the 100th ranking out of 103 investments. Starbucks has been in the Unfavored zone since June of last year and is down around -25% during this time period. 

US same-store sales dropped by 3% compared to an expectation of more than 1.2% as cautious consumer spending and a deteriorating economic environment weighed on customer traffic. Similarly, China experienced a decline of 11% in sales against an expected 2%. Operational margin stood at 12.8%, lower than the expected 14.4%, with EPS at $0.68 compared to the expected $0.80. Global revenue growth is pegged at low-single digits, compared with the previous guidance for a 7% to 10% gain. The retailer also forecasts global comparable store sales to be flat to down by low-single digits, compared with prior expectations for 4% to 6% growth. The company's long-term growth depends on several sales drivers and correcting some recent actions, as well as implementing cost efficiency measures according to analysts. Looking at a candlestick chart over the last five years using weekly time periods, we can see SBUX gap down significantly on the earnings miss yesterday marking the largest one week drop in this time frame. This has continued its recent trend downwards from its all-time highs from July of 2021 and its recent one year high from May of 2023. We could see support just below the $70 level based on previous lows from the spring of 2022 and past moves.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is currently in a column of 17 O's in a 2% Point and Figure chart which represents around a 35% drawdown while filtering out the short term noise. To the downside, support can now be found at around $70 and below this at $65.85 which corresponds to the lows from 2022 and the summer of 2020."

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
1202,Potential Estimated Economic Impact (Oil and VIX) of War üáÆüá∑ üáÆüá±,wallstreetbets,S&P Global,26,37,14-04-2024 21:54:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c45esj/potential_estimated_economic_impact_oil_and_vix/,"*TL;DR: Just look at the image with the three scenarios.*

&#x200B;

The fray between Israel and Iran has ruffled the feathers of traders and tycoons alike.  
You should remember that oil was already prancing around $90 a barrel due to snug supply-demand antics, and some expect this latest act of hostility has tossed a hefty log onto the fire.

Iran's bold strike‚Äîa direct jab for once, rather than through the shadowy limbs of proxies‚Äîhas marked a new chapter in this age-old drama.

This escalation could send oil prices leaping out of their boots when trading resumes in New York later today (18:00 ET).

Giovanni Staunovo, an analyst at UBS Group AG:

>Oil prices might spike at the opening, as this is the first time Iran struck Israel from its territory. **How long any bounce will last will also depend on the Israeli response.**

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ndrxwilkeiuc1.jpg?width=1024&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fa8c035308e26a7dbc9f2b5e23b2b034ed22cbc7

&#x200B;

The market, already skittish, now has more to chew on, especially with **threats looming over the vital Strait of Hormuz, where a fifth of the world's oil flows** as if through the eye of a needle.

Prices, which already include a risk premium of about $10 a barrel, are poised to push higher, warned Iman Nasseri, the Middle East managing director at consultancy FGE.

>Prices could add another $2 to $5 a barrel due to **concern of further Israeli reprisals or Iranian interference with shipping around the Persian Gulf**.

&#x200B;

It seems the oil markets are braced for a bumpy ride. As tensions simmer, and with OPEC+ keeping a tight lid on production, this latest episode might strain global stockpiles even further.

According to Rosalind Mathieson, a Bloomberg News Director:

>As with other market assets, **the outlook for oil seems to hinge on any Israeli response to the Iranian attack.** Trading resumes at 6pm New York time on Sunday. The risk of a direct Iranian attack on Israel was already at least partly priced in ‚Äî benchmark Brent crude, up 17% this year, passed $90 a barrel after the strike on Iran‚Äôs diplomatic compound in Syria.

Here's what the smart cats at Bloomberg estimated could happen.  
I should point out that at this point in time, we might be moving into the purple band.

&#x200B;

[from Bloomberg Economics](https://preview.redd.it/nvvreyf3diuc1.jpg?width=1200&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=29db1a212dc1e8db614a250d492429cc765f5252)

&#x200B;

On Wednesday, we'll get the weekly crude oil inventories (prior +5.84 mln) at 10:30 ET.  
It won't move the markets, but people will pay more attention.

As for the closing numbers from Friday:

CL00-USA Crude Oil futures: $0.58 higher (+0.7%) at $85.58/barrel.  
NG00-USA Nat Gas: (0.0%) at $1.77/MMBtu.  
RB00-USA RBOB Gasoline: $0.02 higher (+0.7%) at $2.80/gallon.  
HO00-USA Heating oil futures: $0.03 higher (+1.1%) at $2.69/gallon.

&#x200B;

I won't delve into what each country should or should not do.  
I can only control what I do.

If Israel's response adds a log to the fire, I'm building my watchlist for those sectors that are bound to get panicky sellers‚Äîthose who rely on oil prices.

So far, I'm planning to short **IBIT**, but I will wait to see either a weak open or confirmation regarding Israel's response. Assuming she gaps down, I'll wait to avoid an expected initial bounce.

That's the iShares Bitcoin Trust.  
My thesis is that those investors who trust Bitcoin will invest directly in Bitcoin.  
Those who are dwindling their feet in that water through an ETF are bound to get jittery.  
And also, it might get more expensive for Bitcoin miners to operate, I assume.

I will wait to see if **LUV** convincingly breaks her support at around $27.  
If she does and other airlines follow along, I might even go with **FLYD**, instead. That's the MicroSectors Travel 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN.

And I will keep my eyes on **OILD** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x Inverse Leveraged ETN) and **OILU** (MicroSectors Oil & Gas Exploration & Production 3x ETN).  
Unless the direct conflict turns into war (instead of calculated act-and-wait), I will just play shares and not options since I'm not willing to pay for volatility or not reacting as fast.

&#x200B;

As a short-term swing trader, I'll mostly avoid any overnight positions.  
There are bound to be some big trend-follower players that might offload, so I'll keep an eye out on which sector they run out first. I'll do this by keeping an eye out on all the SPDR ETFs. Well, the top and bottom parts of that list.

&#x200B;

Have a good day.

P.S. I'm certainly not hoping for war. But war‚Äîor the potential of war‚Äîcan move markets, and as a trader, I play what the market shows me."

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

*Financials Overview:*
	‚Ä¢	2024 sales projection: $6.88B, increasing to $7.27B in 2025.

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.


I dont have financial advice but buying stock at the dip and holding long or buying leaps the safer bet to me, but we‚Äôre on wsb bay bay. Also I‚Äôm a regard and bought too early in the dip. I probably should have waited until things calm down a bit. But I‚Äôm gonna hold regardless. GLHF

1207,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal‚Äôs Best Friend,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,75,53,05-05-2024 03:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cki4bo/elf_an_inflationfatigued_gals_best_friend/,"Gather round, friends. We‚Äôre cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

Not financial advice :)"
1208,"The US Senate is now working to DELIST marijuana from the CSA, effectively legalizing it federally. ",wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,1361,314,01-05-2024 07:31:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chg776/the_us_senate_is_now_working_to_delist_marijuana/,"[Full Article](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-statement-on-deas-historic-step-to-reclassify-cannabis-as-less-harmful-drug)

The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act deschedules cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely. This would effectively legalize cannabis at the federal level, removing many operational hurdles.

Then there‚Äôs the SAFER Banking Act, which will make it easier for companies to access capital, and to attract more large-scale investors. 

Rescheduling Cannabis to Schedule III is a game changer on its own. And, if either of these bills become law, we are talking multi-billion dollar market cap increases on some of the best positioned companies in the US (CGC in particular, but also TLRY in my opinion, due to the former's existing warrants to purchase cannabis companies in the US on rescheduling, and TLRY's penchant for expansion and acquisition).

My position: The Biden administration has gone through the bureaucracy of the Health and Human Services and now through the DEA to provide effective health and safety cover for the Senate's upcoming initiative.  This will put the Republican House in the spotlight, and my hope is that they will follow the position of their voters and pass the bill (but they have taken a fairly obstructionist position over the past 2 decades, so who knows, but they have extremely difficult headwinds on their horizon, so I think it looks good!)

When these bill are introduced, I would anticipate fairly significant upside market reactions. When they pass the Senate, we will see even more.  If the Republicans vote with the people and get it out of committee, we will see millionaires being created this year.

My recommendation:  BUY CALLS that expire in JAN 2025 to take advantage of this upside, while giving yourself enough time and room to weather the inevitable hills and valleys the market will go through while these bills make it through the Legislature.  Hold them, and wait.  They are still WAY UNDERPRICED in my opinion, given the rescheduling alone, and now with this news on the horizon.

Good luck everyone!

1209,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,269,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."

1211,Liquidated My Entire Portfolio Today - Here's Why (w/ Due Diligence & Citations),wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,545,511,26-04-2024 04:29:47,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cdceq4/liquidated_my_entire_portfolio_today_heres_why_w/,"Today, I trusted my gut after months of contemplating, and I liquidated my entire portfolio. Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.
* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say ""wow, my savings are losing value""; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to.

‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢‚Ä¢

Most pet owners know Chewy as a source for all things pet goods ‚Äì toys, treats, leashes, and even medication. 

Now, Chewy is branching out to also provide veterinary services. The retailer announced it will launch vet clinics across the country known as Chewy Vet Care. 

‚ÄúWe partnered with hundreds of veterinarians and customers to design an in-practice and post-visit experience which we believe will be unlike anything in the market, and appreciated by both communities,‚Äù said Mita Malhotra, president of Chewy Health. ‚ÄúOur practices contain thoughtfully designed spaces for the comfort and privacy of our customers and our care team. 

‚ÄúChewy Vet Care will be powered by our proprietary, easy-to-use modern technology, to deliver a seamless and memorable experience, which we have delivered for over a decade in our core businesses.‚Äù 

A look inside the Chew Vet Care clinics

Chewy has implemented some key features in their clinics to make the experience as easy as possible for pets and their owners. These include: 

Separate waiting areas to promote a calm environment for anxious pets 

Spacious exam rooms to help pets feel more comfortable 

Digital pet portal to give pet owners access to all records and invoices and share updates and reminders from the vet 

Digital monitors in each exam room with your pet‚Äôs picture 

Personalized discharge instructions for each pet

When it comes to veterinary services, Chewy clinics will include: 

Urgent/emergency care services during business hours 

Dental care

Vaccinations

Surgeries and procedures

Travel certificates

24/7 health guidance 

New pet care

Pet owners must create an account with Chewy prior to taking their pet to the vet clinics, though a formal membership isn‚Äôt required. Pet owners can also submit their bills from Chewy Vet Care to their pet insurance providers for reimbursement. 

Two Chewy Vet Care clinics have already opened ‚Äì one in Highlands Ranch, Colo., and one in Plantation, Fla. More locations are scheduled to open this year in Coral Gables, Fla.; Denver; Fountain Oaks, Ga.; and Perimeter, Ga. 

‚ÄúThis is one of the most significant moments in Chewy‚Äôs history as we open the doors to our Chewy Vet Care practices and physically become a part of our customers‚Äô lives and in their neighborhoods,‚Äù Malhotra said. ‚ÄúOur team has worked relentlessly to create an experience that is extraordinary and memorable for pets, customers, and our veterinary teams.‚Äù

They are also building a 85,000 h100 supercomputer for training, that's a multibillion dollar supercomputer running the feedback of an army of employees.

Oops, how did that dynamite get in there‚Ä¶? Well, for every potential rocket, there‚Äôs the chance it explodes in your face.

I‚Äôve worked in Big Tech and FinTech, and think SoFi has a good shot at differentiating their offerings in the FinTech sector and recognizing a higher valuation, as they grow their technology offerings. 

Specifically watching Galileo and Technisys. When you talk platforms and banking cores, it‚Äôs easy to lose people, but this is where the wonder of finance happens.

Outside of that, the continued cross selling of services will be important and lowered customer acquisition costs, which I think is doable.

May be a diamond in the rough. Figured I'd share to help people out with an unconventional idea.

Looking at the intrinsic value of the company I did a 0% growth rate which gave a value of $72.78 (Slightly below the current price of $74.15) when I bumped it up to a 1% growth rate it gave $89.91 which is at a discount of about 21%.

They have averaged a growth rate of 18% in their EPS over the last 5 years. So I put into the calculator a growth rate of 5% which provided an intrinsic value of 158.40, which would be a return of 213%. And they pay a dividend.

The company has been around since 1963 and the CEO started at the company at 16 years old as a service clerk (posted a picture).  And just 4 days ago the company announced a stock buyback of 2 million shares.

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
1218,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,79,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

1220,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,60,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

I expect this gradual decline to continue, even though I believe it's a long-term buy.

One of the issues is that people tend to get very emotional when discussing Boeing, and that's a problem in itself. But in the short to medium term, Boeing will also be suffering from some significant cash flow challenges:

1. Defense Business: Boeing is working through some very poor defense contracts. These will roll off in the coming years, but defense margins remain very poor in the meantime.
2. Commercial Business: Boeing has had to deal with poor contracts from the COVID-19 pandemic, unproductive production lines, and inventory issues. The news flow doesn't help, and it's possible they may not get back to full production until next year.
3. Services Business: This part of the business is doing fine, but how long can it support the two money-losing segments?

The underlying value is there, but these fundamental cash flow issues go beyond just the negative news. In the next 3-6 months, I believe Boeing is a bad buy.

The stock should benefit from a reset, but that will be difficult given Boeing's semi-governmental status and the politics they have to manage. It's essentially a value trap right now. I think it's a screaming buy once they work through these problems, but not yet.  Stay away!"

Drugs don't count, although probably your dealer asked you to CashApp him/her. It doesn't matter if you're a luxury retailer, or a mom and pop shop, you probably have seen the Square terminals everywhere you go. They're going even further to integrate, that lots of restaurants just hand you your check with a QR code for payment.... with you guessed it, powered by Block. To be honest, I don't even carry my wallet with me anymore. My phone does everything -- unlocks my car, pays for stuff, etc. Block hit over $275 during COVID because people didn't want to handle cash! We are trending in that direction anyway.

Management: Now that Dorsey's back, he's laser focused both on improving expenses (think ""year of efficiency"" a la Zuckerberg) and  ongrowing Square terminals and having cashapp be the de-facto way to transfer cash/crypto between people. Venmo is good, but it doesn't have vertical integration.

**Grupo Aeropuerto Del Pacifico (PAC):** Thesis: This one was a weird one I stumbled across. I follow many influencers and the hot place to go to these days seem to be Tulum, Cancun, Cabo, Puerto Vallarta. What do these things all have in common? They're owned by this publicly traded company! I decided to take a trip with my buddies to see what the hype was about. I was blown away. Food, 5 star hotels, amazing weather, hot latinas, private beach cabana, bottle service, all for a THIRD of the price of what you'd get in the USA! No wonder these influencers are able to afford this -- wintering/summering in the Hamptons or Miami (or really, anywhere in the USA) are for chumps these days. Their 2nd biggest airport, Tijuana International, just got a 100m joint USA-MEX investment, and I tell you, looks amazing. I'm really glad they took the time during COVID to expand, because these airports (at least CUN which I just got back last week) was packed to the hilt. Americans and Mexicans everywhere. (Recession? What recession?)

Management are really good at issuing a healthy dividend and re-investing money back into expansion, so I really believe in them.

  
Positions: Just stock. I don't know the timeline enough to play options, all I know is that it's long term consistent (and boring at times) growth.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring?

As a result, defaults by, or even rumors or questions about, one or more financial services institutions, or the financial services industry generally, can lead to market-wide liquidity problems and losses or defaults by us or by other institutions. Many of these transactions could expose us to credit risk in the event of default by a counterparty. In addition, our credit risk may be impacted when the collateral held by us cannot be realized upon or is liquidated at prices not sufficient to recover the full amount of the financial instrument exposure due to us.

Liquidity is derived primarily from retail deposit growth and earnings retention, principal and interest payments on loans and investment securities, net cash provided from operations and access to other funding. If we are unable to maintain adequate liquidity, then our business, financial condition and results of operations could be negatively impacted.""

1226,Ramblings of a Remora: The size of the future AI market is truly hard to fathom and it's impact hard to imagine.,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,8,14,05-04-2024 18:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwpl5n/ramblings_of_a_remora_the_size_of_the_future_ai/,"It begins as a ""tool"", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

1227,Uber is 100% going to miss earnings. Badly.,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,8718,1057,05-04-2024 17:52:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwof0q/uber_is_100_going_to_miss_earnings_badly/,"I couldn't sleep last night, so I began looking through Uber's last earnings results because there seems to be a major disconnect between sentiment towards the stock and my own perceived experience with their service (which is to say not good).

And boy did I find something interesting hidden in there.

For the three months ended on December 31st, 2023, they reported net income of $1.43 billion. That represents a 141% year over year increase and 66 cents per share against expectations of 17 cents- not bad at all. Way to go Dara!

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."
1228,Higher Oil/Gas will push for greater EV adoption. ,wallstreetbets,ServiceNow,0,68,05-04-2024 14:19:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwj80w/higher_oilgas_will_push_for_greater_ev_adoption/,"High oil prices are creating a favorable environment for EV adoption by making EVs more attractive over ICE.

1. Oil prices are going higher, much higher mainly because of the middle east conflict and Russian cutting output. Ukraine is also attacking Russia's refineries putting them out of service. My thought is oil prices will get to $100+ if Iran retaliates and Saudi's don't boost production to make up the difference. Also the Strategic Petroleum reserves are being used and not refilled, we may reach a point when reserves get super low. This is good for US oil companies though.
2. There is economic incentives for EV's none for ICE. People who buy new electric vehicles may be eligible for a tax credit as high as $7,500, and used electric car buyers may qualify for up to $4,000. California residents get extra incentives. We are in a election year, we may see more incentives if oil gets out of control.
3. last month Biden issued an executive order to speed up the elimination of ICE cars and push for more EV adoption. This would create a rotation out of ICE cars and into EV's. This comes at a bad time as GM and Ford are scaling back EV production.

[https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html](https://www.nytimes.com/2024/03/20/climate/biden-phase-out-gas-cars.html)

I think things in the middle east will escalate so will things with Russia/NATO. This will push oil prices to very high levels and will lead to a EV rush. Tesla's inventory should shrink as prices are super low.  All commodities are going higher right now. No one wants to pay $10 per gallon of gas or $100+ for a fill up each week."

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

March 19: Gogoro Named by Fast Company as Asia-Pacific‚Äôs #1 Most Innovative Company of 2024 and #37 Most Innovative Company Globally.

Fast Company is a highly respected publication, and this award further underscores Gogoro's recent recognition (Oct 4, 2023) by the MIT Technology Review, affirming its status as an innovative company and a key player in climate technology worth monitoring.

**Gogoro Partner News**

March 15: Zypp Electric achieved the remarkable distinction of being named the top-ranked company in the Financial Times and Statista's annual ranking of high-growth Asia-Pacific companies ‚Äì an incredible accomplishment!

With Gogoro's leadership, Zypp secured $25 million in Series B funding and solidified its position as Gogoro's strategic partner in India. They have recently placed orders for the first batches of locally manufactured scooters in their B2B fleet. I'm eagerly anticipating further orders as the battery swapping network expands and Zypp continues to extend its presence.

[https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024](https://www.ft.com/high-growth-asia-pacific-ranking-2024)

April 3: Zypp Electric posts 3x revenue growth in FY24 and is now operationally profitable. Zypp is Gogoro's major partner in India so it's absolutely great news. 

 ""On the fleet front, we intend to grow our current strength of 20,000 to around 100,000 vehicles in the next 12 to 18 months and then grow that to 500,000 over the following 36 to 48 months.""

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

1232,Why I'm getting AMZN calls for today's earnings,wallstreetbets,Snap-on,264,207,30-04-2024 16:03:31,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cgwhxy/why_im_getting_amzn_calls_for_todays_earnings/,"Amazon (AMZN) is scheduled to report its fiscal Q1 2024 results **today.** I expect amazon to do well today on both earnings and revenues, and I'll explain why here. The company outperformed the street expectations in the last quarter, with net revenues increasing by 14% to $170 billion. It was driven by a 13% rise in the North America and Amazon web services segments, followed by a 17% gain in the International division. We expect the first quarter result to follow the same trend. I also am anticipating Amazon will release a dividend like META and GOOG, which I'll go into a lot of detail later. 

Let's talk about AMZN's ride over the past few years‚Äîit's been a bit of a roller coaster, especially when you stack it up against the S&P 500. Back in early 2021, AMZN was hovering around $165. Fast forward to now, and it's ticked up to about $180. Sounds decent, right? But hold up, because that's nothing compared to the S&P, which has shot up by roughly 35% in the same period.

Looking at the yearly breakdown: AMZN only inched up by 2% in 2021, then took a massive 50% dive in 2022, but bounced back hard with an 81% surge in 2023. Meanwhile, the S&P 500 had its own drama but less extreme, posting a 27% gain in 2021, dropping 19% in 2022, and climbing back up by 24% in 2023.

The takeaway? While AMZN did outperform the S&P in 2023, it lagged behind in the previous years. And this isn't just an AMZN thing‚Äîother big names in the Consumer Discretionary sector like TSLA, TM, and HD, and even tech giants like GOOG, MSFT, and AAPL have also found it tough to consistently beat the S&P, in both up and down markets. So, what's next for AMZN? Let's keep our eyes peeled for their upcoming earnings report.

# Revenue Beat

Amazon‚Äôs revenues grew 12% y-o-y to $574.8 billion in FY2023. All major categories posted growth in the year ‚Äì online stores (5%), physical stores (6%), third-party seller services (19%), subscription services (14%), advertising services (24%), and AWS (13%). We expect the same trend to continue in Q1. Overall, we forecast Amazon‚Äôs revenues to touch $641.4 billion for the full-year 2024.

# EPS Beat 

Amazon Q1 2024 adjusted earnings per share is expected to be $0.85 per Trefis analysis, 2% above the consensus estimate of $0.83. The adjusted net income increased from -$2.7 billion to $30.4 billion in FY 2023. It was primarily because of lower operating expenses as a % of revenues, higher revenues, and a significant jump in the total non-operating income from -$18.2 billion to $705 million. Notably, the non-operating income was down in 2022 due to a marketable equity securities valuation loss. Further, the same trend was witnessed in Q4 2023. We expect the Q1 results to be on similar lines. Overall, Amazon is likely to report an annual GAAP EPS of $4.12 and revenue per share of $61.48 for the full-year 2024.

# Possible Dividend Announcement

Meta threw out its first dividend this March, and Google's parent company Alphabet isn't far behind, announcing a 20 cent dividend set for mid-June. This leaves us wondering about Amazon‚Äîwhen are they joining the dividend party?

By the numbers, it seems like it‚Äôs about time Amazon starts giving back some quarterly cash to its shareholders. Over the last decade, Amazon has racked up a cool $90 billion in free cash flow. Out of that giant pot, it only used about $6 billion for share buybacks in 2022, which is roughly a 7% capital return.

In comparison, other trillion-dollar behemoths have been way more generous, returning about 75% of their free cash flow over the past year‚Äîthough most of that was through share repurchases rather than dividends. Together, these non-Amazon trillion-dollar companies generated around $323 billion in cash flow over the last year, paid out $38 billion in dividends, and snapped up about $240 billion in their own stock.

For Amazon, cash flow isn't the issue. Wall Street's looking at a projected free cash flow of about $62 billion for 2024, which is expected to jump to $82 billion by 2025, per Bloomberg. So, the big question remains: when will Amazon start sending some of that cash flow back to shareholders in the form of dividends? Let's stay tuned and see if they'll open up their wallet.

But what would this look like? If Amazon decided to payout 75% of its projected 2024 free cash flow, we're talking about a dividend yield of around 2.4%. That actually beats the average 2.2% yield from other dividend-paying companies in the S&P.

This 2.4% isn't just dividends‚Äîit includes any buybacks Amazon might throw into the mix. To give you a benchmark, the total shareholder yield for S&P 500 dividend payers has been about 3.3% over the past year. With Amazon‚Äôs hefty cash flow, it‚Äôs looking more and more like they‚Äôre due to start sharing the wealth.

Just for context, consider a bit of history. Microsoft went public back in 1986, and it took them 17 years and a revenue climb from less than $200 million to $32 billion before they started paying dividends in 2003. Since then, Microsoft‚Äôs sales have been growing at a steady 10% yearly, with around $28 in dividends per share dished out to date. Fast forward to 2024, Microsoft‚Äôs expected to hit sales around $260 billion.

Amazon, on the other hand, went public in 1997 and has exploded from $600 million to nearly $600 billion in annual sales. With projections showing a growth rate of about 12% over the next few years, Amazon is well-positioned to both fuel further growth and start paying dividends.

Currently, Microsoft‚Äôs stock yields about 0.8%. If Amazon wanted to match this, they‚Äôd need to allocate roughly 20% of their forecasted free cash flow for the next two years to dividends‚Äîtotally doable since S&P 500 dividend payers typically spend about half their free cash flow on dividends.

Bottom line: Amazon doesn‚Äôt need to aim for a 0.8% yield right off the bat. Kicking things off with literally any dividend would be a solid move. And if they do so, the stock will PUMP. This is why I'm getting calls for earnings. A call spread would be good, for those who can't get a call spread, AMZN 5/3 190c @ 3.20 doesn't look too bad. I'm picking 190c because the stock has *on average* moved about 7% up or down with earnings. A 7% push up today would bring the stock to about 192ish. Not enough for the calls to profit, so getting a call spread is deal. To do this, I'll just sell the 200c @ 1.19. So the cost of the whole position becomes 2.01/share. Not too bad. Good luck guys."
1233,Mouse Ear Puts FTW ($DIS),wallstreetbets,Snap-on,23,58,28-04-2024 20:15:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cffwf2/mouse_ear_puts_ftw_dis/,"Mouse Ears Puts FTW ($DIS)

Happy Sunday!

Not terribly long ago I was ridiculed for suggesting $SNAP calls could make you money even though my approach was to exit prior to ER. I can‚Äôt be right twice, so here goes nothing‚Ä¶.

Securing $DIS puts first thing Monday to me is an absolute low risk effort to not only scalp some nice gains but also achieve those baggers y‚Äôall like instead of being bagholders.

I already missed out on scoring these on the cheap early April as I was too busy being a regard elsewhere. Luckily the IV on contracts expiring 5/10 (after ER mind you) are still quite low and I expect IV to throttle up to 150% or more by this time next week. 

While the mouse ears is great at screwing bears over, my sound bullet proof reasoning is below:

- they just secured a proxy ‚Äúvictory‚Äù which is anything but to me. It shows blood in the water and hostility, not to mention doubt that their current leadership can actually power through and make them the blue chip they once were.

- they have had an awful run at the box office lately. While I think the FUTURE releases of movies bodes well for them longer term, I see this as a very reasonable and logical place for Wall Street to knock them down a rung without giving too much value into forward movie guidance.

- Bob Iger is a gap filler IMO. I don‚Äôt know how any long term shareholder of this company for the last 5 years could be excited compared to the rest of the market.

- they throttled way up last earnings. In line with other stocks it seems like a balance of once blessed and once cursed, which will happen when they enter ER. 

- IV will continue to increase leading up to earnings, which will help all contracts in value.

- I expect this week to be a red week and not pushing 52W H, so I would like to see DIS move to $105 by EOW ideally. Oh yeah FOMC this week too!

The play:

$105p 5/10 exp. Available for a cool $1 or so with great opportunity to not only be ITM prior to earnings but also along with the kick in IV to see a nice 60-200% increase in value without even playing the ER call.

My position: will comment Monday AM when I secure position.

My exit: if I double by EOW I will sell at least half and let the rest ride.

Prediction: $DIS to $93 by 5/10, probably 5/9. If my prediction is correct, it will make those $105 puts be worth well more than 10x what they are now.

Best of luck!"

You might wonder how I ended up in this erm, position. 

*record scratch*

For the sake of amusement and educational value, I certainly hope some of you might learn from my mistakes instead of stepping on the same rake.

It all began a few weeks ago.

https://preview.redd.it/5dbpqb1u65xc1.png?width=1080&format=png&auto=webp&s=14416697d69805e00b82eb53b072617b20a466dd

I got greedy. And greedy people make mistakes.

When Trump's Truth Social became a public company with the shittiest fundamentals known to mankind, no business plan and staggering losses, it was a no-brainer to short it. I learned options just so I could!

And the money was good. My first short had an expiration date of Jan 2025 and the strike price was $25. But because of all the greeks and short interest I sold it at a profit when DJT traded over $30! Wild. It retained its value so well because of long expiration date (theta).

Then I did some other trades, most of them reasonably successful and briefly my account went above $200k. That gave me a sense of false confidence. Easy money! Why, I could just make a thousand dollars a day shorting this thing and calling that thing. I just need a bit more practice. Right?

What I realized is that some options turn a profit in seconds and others can take days and weeks. And 1% for a minute of your time is better returns than 15% after two weeks of incubation.

Then I noticed that of all the trades I made the one that persistently delivered was DJT. It just kept sliding down on a schedule. It had places to be, somewhere between $0 and $2, as it seemed at the time.

So I yolod over 40k on a bet I thought would take a day or two at most. And to make it more profitable I reduced the expiration date to only a couple of weeks, so I could get more contracts for the price.

And then DJT shot up, changing trajectory that has been very predictable up to that point.

Why? Because it trades on sentiment, not fundamentals. Because market conditions. Because boohoo some evil hedgefund managers buy up shares so they can sell shorts and the low trade volume makes it easy to manipulate the stock price? BULLSHIT. These are self-delusions and lies. I don't know why, and never will, because I'm a retail trader and not an institution. 

THE EASIEST LIE IS THE ONE YOU TELL YOURSELF.

I can do my own research, sure, but I don't have the time to make it a full time job. Because of this, I will not have all the information that professionals have at their disposal. I hardly know what questions to ask.

A couple days later, looking at DJT (it should bounce down any day now!) I bought another put, this time aiming for $29 (it was trading around $30). I think they call it 'revenge trading' or 'emotional trading'. Don't do that.

Don't double down on a bad bet. Our brains use a lot of cheat codes to make snap decisions in stressful situations. We get adrenaline, our hearts start racing, our palms start sweating and our brains shut down higher brain functions to improve reaction time, known as 'fight or flight' response. It's great for hunting tigers and wolves. It's a really bad idea to do this when math is involved. And our tech is evolving faster than our bodies.

If you think you might be getting upset and not thinking things through, it's time to stop for the day and come back to it in the morning.

What else? Don't bet more than 10% of your port on any one company or event. Diversify. 

If you keep betting an increasing amount of money, no matter how certain the odds are, eventually the revolver drum will find the one bullet that will take you out in the Russian roulette you build out of your option contract. You're building a mouse trap to catch yourself, so uh, pad the walls a little. Make it a bit comfy.

As for me, I think my best option (teehee) is to fold and liquidate those bets on Monday on the best terms I can find, so I stop chasing the sunk cost fallacy and invest in something that can be more predictable in turning a profit. But I'm open to suggestions! I can't say that it's not tempting to let my puts ride all the way to $0. Part of me keeps wondering if it sinks down to 28 this week for no reason at all. But I also recognize this as a stage of grief known as 'bargaining'. 

I also believe DJT is still a penny stock that will go to $2 in September when Trump cashes out his cut and the price goes down, but my contracts don't have that long. Until September, it will fluctuate wildly, 1-15% a day in either direction as foreign interests and local patriots press buttons to make the money machine go brrr for fun and profit.

Could I straddle it and make some money back? Sure, but there are safer ways to make money right now and I'm going to focus on things with higher probabilities of success. 

This was the most expensive lesson of my life and if you read this far, you got it for free. You're welcome.

So stop munching on those crayons and think about contingency plans instead of throwing all your money on the next ""sure thing"". Options give you higher profits but there is a cost. And that cost is, you can lose everything. When a share price goes down, shares usually don't drop 30% in a day. 

So if you don't want your epitaph to be ""expired worthless"", think a little harder and double check the dates before you piss your money and metaphors against the wind.

When it comes to eggs, billions of chickens are laying them daily, at peak, every 16 hours. Eggs last forever, the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes, they grow faster than ever.

You can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.

# How do I know this?

3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.

The one that matters here is live chickens.

The highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.

Ever wonder what $8,200,000 worth of chickens look like?

Feast your eyes on this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3titj0f0khtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7baeb7d3894554dd278b29603db3347e1f2f9

8,200 chickens worth $1,000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn, 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them, I was escorted down the highway, blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16,500,000 worth of chickens, 4,500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.

(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist, supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)

These are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ijxydf37vhtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320935df12c355485139c5e06ea560209f11be13

I've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10,000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather, it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there, they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).

# There won't be a shortage of chicken, meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.

&#x200B;

Let's discuss beef for a second.

Beef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also, of all the mafia ridden shit going, beef is definitely it.

There are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.

\- feminine hygiene products

\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)

\- frozen meat

&#x200B;

If they did, you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint, or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.

On the other hand, it's abundant. 

Being Canadian, we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;

\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022, Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))

\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada‚Äôs beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)

There is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef, 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.

Final point:

Who is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  
Brazil  
**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023, followed by India, which exports water buffalo, the United States and Australia. Mar 5, 2024

&#x200B;

# This is also not the play.

&#x200B;

Ok, so what is the play?

# MILK

&#x200B;

This shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.

You can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. 

The substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.

\- school milk programs

\- cheese production

\- butter

\- ice cream

\- yogurt

&#x200B;

You might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.

This is where you're wrong.

""In the barn"" means ""in the workers"".

The industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. 

Let's visualize that journey:

\- It starts at the feed mill.

\- Then it's a truck driver.

\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.

\- Another driver who collects the milk.

\- A dock worker.

\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.

\- Another truck driver.

\- The person stocking the shelves.

&#x200B;

Whether you realize it or not, that's 50+ people.

Thinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.

If a cow gets sick, they produce way less milk.

The following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while, she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse, the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.

[The last time this happened, they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)

&#x200B;

This should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.

&#x200B;

# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.

&#x200B;

Also... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?

&#x200B;

1238,ULTA - selling is overdone,wallstreetbets,Snap-on,24,45,04-04-2024 03:26:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvd3vz/ulta_selling_is_overdone/,"Another one hits my buy zone! Ulta Beauty (ULTA) finally pulled back to my $440 entry point today.  I am all in with 50 Jan 25 options at $480 strike (bought as ULTA hit my trigger).

NOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  

While the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.

A few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:

üí∞ Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data

üíÑ Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way

üíØ Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year

While it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.

The panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450. Elite loyalty ecosystem, smart multi-channel strategy, and flawless execution - what's not to like?? I know analysts are sharpening their pencils, expect possible buy recommendations and a snap back."

1244,DD on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here??,wallstreetbets,Stanley Black & Decker,16,5,18-04-2024 03:05:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6t21z/dd_on_zoetis_zts_risk_reward_looking_attractive/,"This is my first DD so please be gentleüòä

The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04/12:

[https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6)

Quote: ""The FDA received more than 3,800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year. The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12,300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7,700 for Solensia since 2021, when the drugs went on sale in Europe. The figures include reports from the U.S. and other countries outside of the European Union.""

But a 04/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: ""Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products. On recent concerns over Librela side effects,¬†*only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela, 83% have some level of concern but still prescribe, and 13% are not at all concerned.*¬†""

Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings.

Critically, Librela & Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most.

Also per Morgan Stanley:

* ""we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0.73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1.01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)"" -- on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7.8%, pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already?? This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys.
* ""the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption, but for analysis purposes), would be 27.6x FY25 at the current share price, still below its 10-year historical average of 29.2x, suggesting the stock may be overly punished.""

Lastly, let's look at the technical side. ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart. If it continues to hold these levels, I think the risk reward from here will look very attractive!

1245,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,Stanley Black & Decker,214,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/sconsk9a80vc1.jpg?width=950&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=b5c2900ac71c3a215c70f0722e3047c204b3ace6

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

&#x200B;

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Starbucks was already in the Unfavored zone of the SIA S&P 100 Index Report and fell 7 more spots yesterday to the 100th ranking out of 103 investments. Starbucks has been in the Unfavored zone since June of last year and is down around -25% during this time period. 

US same-store sales dropped by 3% compared to an expectation of more than 1.2% as cautious consumer spending and a deteriorating economic environment weighed on customer traffic. Similarly, China experienced a decline of 11% in sales against an expected 2%. Operational margin stood at 12.8%, lower than the expected 14.4%, with EPS at $0.68 compared to the expected $0.80. Global revenue growth is pegged at low-single digits, compared with the previous guidance for a 7% to 10% gain. The retailer also forecasts global comparable store sales to be flat to down by low-single digits, compared with prior expectations for 4% to 6% growth. The company's long-term growth depends on several sales drivers and correcting some recent actions, as well as implementing cost efficiency measures according to analysts. Looking at a candlestick chart over the last five years using weekly time periods, we can see SBUX gap down significantly on the earnings miss yesterday marking the largest one week drop in this time frame. This has continued its recent trend downwards from its all-time highs from July of 2021 and its recent one year high from May of 2023. We could see support just below the $70 level based on previous lows from the spring of 2022 and past moves.

Starbucks Corp (SBUX) is currently in a column of 17 O's in a 2% Point and Figure chart which represents around a 35% drawdown while filtering out the short term noise. To the downside, support can now be found at around $70 and below this at $65.85 which corresponds to the lows from 2022 and the summer of 2020."

While a P/E ratio of 23 might seem high, I recently invested in Starbucks for reasons that go beyond just the numbers.

One key factor is the addictive nature of coffee and the fast consumption of Starbucks' products. This constant cycle keeps customers coming back for more. Additionally, the brand itself, its name recognition, and the inviting atmosphere of its stores are valuable assets that contribute significantly to future revenue streams.

Now, let's delve into the numbers. Starbucks boasts an impressive 25% Sustainable ROIC (Return on Invested Capital) and a healthy average operating margin of 15.5%. Interestingly, despite being a well-established franchise, Starbucks continues to expand at a steady pace, opening roughly 6% new stores annually. This highlights their significant growth potential.

Looking geographically, Starbucks has plenty of room for international expansion. In the US, there's one store per 35,000 people, while Europe has one per 298,000. China boasts one per 20,000, and India has just one per 5.3 million. These figures demonstrate the vast untapped market potential Starbucks possesses. The company's goal of reaching 55,000 stores by 2030 reflects their commitment to further growth.

To assess Starbucks' intrinsic value, I constructed a free cash flow discount model. My assumptions include:

* Revenue growth of 8% with a 32% reinvestment rate until 2030.
* Subsequent 12 years of revenue growth at 4% with a 25% reinvestment rate, acknowledging the potential for slower growth as the company matures.
* Long-term, sustainable growth of 2%.
* Operating margin improvement from 15.5% to 20%.
* Tax rate increase from 25% to 32% to account for potential future government regulations.
* Discount rate of 6%, based on the average US government bond return.

Based on this model, my calculated intrinsic value for Starbucks is $112 per share.

Overall, Starbucks' strong financial performance, combined with their substantial growth potential, makes them a compelling investment opportunity. My valuation model incorporates realistic assumptions, making a strong case for Starbucks' long-term success.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

With this much extra supply and dwindling demand for EVs, it probably makes sense for them to do their plant maintenance now. But everything I see about this company keeps reinforcing that they‚Äôre approaching the end of their runway fast. A share dilution is probably gonna happen soonish.

Let me make it clear to you regards on how Mercedes level 3( drive pilot) is a joke & why Tesla will be big winner in this category. Let‚Äôs go over each category here

Mercedes level 3 autonomy is what they call drive pilot & we all know Tesla level 2 autonomy is fsd.

Here‚Äôs the big differences between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot 

1)Mercedes drive pilot can only operate in highways whereas Tesla fsd will work on both highways & city streets

2) The speed limit on Mercedes drive pilot is 40mph max whereas Tesla fsd is 85mph, here Mercedes drive pilot needs to follow other vehicles whereas in Tesla case it is not required to follow other vehicles.

3) Regarding the traffic patterns Mercedes is not capable of handling interchange whereas Tesla fsd is capable of most of the traffic patterns

4) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work with flashing lights in the area, meanwhile Tesla fsd functions with flashing lights 

5) Mercedes drive pilot doesn‚Äôt work in construction zones, Tesla fsd operates in the construction zones

6) Mercedes drive pilot usage in day time only whereas Tesla fsd can work in daytime or nighttime use

7) Mercedes drive pilot cannot change lanes whereas Tesla fsd can change lanes 

8) Mercedes drive pilot needs the lane lines whereas for Tesla fsd lane lines is not required 

9) Mercedes drive pilot is functioning only in California & Nevada whereas Tesla fsd in all 50 states, Tesla in the last 24hr Tesla has launched subscriptions for Enhanced Autopilot (EAP) in China, as many expect that the company could soon launch its Full Self-Driving (FSD) in the country

So if you look above the staggering difference between Tesla fsd & Mercedes drive pilot, Tesla is making a steady progress & will be big winner in this category. 

Now before you tesla haters, üêª open your mouth on how Tesla fsd is still level 2 autonomy & is inferior to Mercedes drive pilot, remember to do some research. Tesla hate on wsb is getting real & constant fudge on how Tesla will fail is laughable 

They won‚Äôt go bankrupt, yes they had a shitty quarter but holding 27 billion cash. If tesla can‚Äôt make it no other evs. Atleast Tesla is making money on every car they sell whereas wsb darling rivian is losing 40k for every car they sell.

If Jpow keeps interest rates high rivian is fucked big time

In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "
1262,Making the Case for Cabaletta Bio (CABA),wallstreetbets,State Street Corporation,10,6,23-04-2024 04:48:06,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1caw29j/making_the_case_for_cabaletta_bio_caba/,"Quick overview of their relevant stats:

Free Float ‚Äì 44.7M
Market Cap ‚Äì $642M
Technology ‚Äì CAR-T therapy

Targets/Indications ‚Äì Lupus, Myositis, Systemic Sclerosis, mucosal pemphigus Vulgaris, and Myasthenia Gravis (all of them are scary debilitating diseases).

Runway until mid-26‚Äô, and a stated intention to find ‚Äústrategic partnership(s)‚Äù.

Two short-term clinical trial readouts for Lupus (SLE) and Myositis.


The Science:

CAR-T therapies for oncological targets have been all the craze in medicine in the recent past, and in particular, blood cancers.  It‚Äôs not a new treatment, but now it‚Äôs being used to treat indications that are not cancer.  

Cells from the patient are taken in a blood draw.  They are then mixed with a virus that easily infects human cells.  The virus itself does not carry any genetic information of the virus; it carries the genetic information on how to identify and kill a B-cell.  The ‚Äúinfected‚Äù cells that now carry the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genetic targeting information are then put into a media where they can grow.  Once they reach an optimal population, they are put back into the patient.  These ‚ÄúCAR-T‚Äù cells then kill off the problematic B-cells in the patient‚Äôs body for a prolonged period of time, and then the patient‚Äôs B-cells repopulate months/years down the road without them engaging in an autoimmune response (attacking/killing the good cells).  

Without sounding like a big salesman for the company (I have no affiliation with the company), there have been striking results published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  It‚Äôs important to note that this Journal has a very high standard of publishing quality data.  They have shown that the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù (genetic bits that go into the CAR-T cell) will effectively kill off the autoimmune-related B-cells that are hurting the patient, and that there will be a ‚Äúdurable‚Äù effect on the patient (+2 years).  The technology was born out of U-Penn and Oxford and they are partnered with WuXi to scale their initial products.


The stock:

With very little news, the stock peaked around $25 and change.  It has since flittered back down to the low teens and has been bumping around some support lines.  The usual shorting (21% of free float), but nothing too crazy going on.  The analysts SP forecast range is from $25 - $50.  Their corporate slide deck says that they will have their first clinical readouts for both Lupus and Myositis during the first half of this year and we‚Äôre nearly late-April right now.  They will have a second readout during the second half.  Seeing that the stock has a relatively low float for a non-commercialized biotech, any good news would propel the SP, and based on the published data so far, it seems like a probable positive outcome, but yeah, Science is tricky sometimes.

I have a handful of near the money July calls, but I do believe that it would jack up above $20 on good data.  I may buy a few far out of the money calls in July too if the data haven‚Äôt been released in early June.

In the past months I have been collecting several articles around the subject in the title.

Elon Musk has always identified with Tesla, and Tesla has always been identified with Musk. But  given the train wreck performance of the business (not discussing here the share price, but just the real numbers and figures of the car business), it might be nice to discuss the topic here:

- Elon was the one deciding for 2.5 million production capacity, and so far its factories are being utilised at 60-70% capacity, with this number going down after the recent layoffs
- this huge production overcapacity forced the hand of the pricing strategy, and after cutting prices globally for more than 15 months, Q1-2024 was the first big quarter of negative growth. Q2-2024 will have negative growth too (bookmakers are much better than the market, for Q2-2024 they are at 392k vs 480k from Wall Street; last Q2 Tesla sold 466k!)
- prices have been lowered again in the üá∫üá∏, confusing even the stronger supporters of Elon
- AI investments have been more words than facts, and many executives from the Tesla chip department left in the recent months https://electrek.co/2023/12/07/tesla-head-dojo-supercomputer-out-over-issues-next-gen/
- China is the big profit center of Tesla, and in the most recent layoffs they have been firing much more workers there. If China dies, Tesla profits simply evaporates (here a link to a Chinese news https://www.eet-china.com/mp/a307257.html where it is said that GigaShanghai will cut production by 30%, with the decision that is really affecting many suppliers in the area since Tesla is their largest customer; Aside from that, Tesla China also cutting personnel in many dept by 30-40%. All Tesla stores seeing cuts)

Zhu in November 2022
The first one talking about Musk succession was the board member of Tesla, James Murdoch, in November 2022. When the stock was spiralling down and the name of Zhou came out, please note he is the number Two at Tesla https://www.reuters.com/technology/tesla-china-boss-zhu-promoted-global-role-company-posting-2023-01-03/

Here a general article on who Zhu is https://www.thewirechina.com/2023/02/26/tesla-tom-zhu/

The CFO in May 2023
The name of the then CFO was made in May 2023 on a newspaper (WSJ) controlled by the family of James Murdoch https://www.wsj.com/articles/tesla-executive-elon-musk-cfo-zach-kirkhorn-b1998ae7

Both the times the stock recovered and nothing happened to Elon. But note that the CFO was fired/resigned in August 2023, replaced by the Chief of Accounting (that is a red flag)

Since then, Elon was accused twice by the WSJ (newspaper of Murdoch) of being a drug addict 
- January 2024 https://www.wsj.com/business/elon-musk-illegal-drugs-e826a9e1
- February 2024 https://www.wsj.com/tech/elon-musk-tesla-money-drugs-board-61af9ac4 in this second one it is said that some Tesla BoD felt forced in consuming drugs with him/did not like this addiction of his, and resigned from the role for that reason

Of course Elon is a free man and he can do what he wants. But these two articles force us to ask several questions:
- why Elon/tesla did not sue the newspapers if the info were false?
- is then the drug addiction somehow related to the erratic pricing strategy and relentless sequence of extreme promises he has made so far ?
- what if some shareholders sue the BoD for lack of oversight asking to be refunded from their losses ? 
- does he really deserves a bonus if the BOD has never been independent ?

Several articles against Elon are questioning his leadership:
- Tesla chair under scrutiny for her oversight on Musk https://www.nytimes.com/2024/02/15/business/teslas-board-elon-musk-robyn-denholm.html
- does Tesla have an Elon Musk problem? https://www.abc.net.au/triplej/programs/hack/hack/103671570

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods.

My prediction, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car, why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!! Buying a network/s would ensure 100% security methods being taken very seriously unlike our present system with telecom companies.

I‚Äôm not saying to make a play because I don‚Äôt know how long this will take to play out but this company literally has no AI tech, weird offerings, dilutions, Goldmans running the market, a history of fraud, being delisted and one of the largest SEC fines.  So many red flags 

I‚Äôm more on the tech side but there‚Äôs so many alarms about this stock and the offering by Goldmans. Plus think of SMCI selling metal enclosures to house GPUs and CPUs.  We had many SMCI boxes that are 5+ years old.  Yes we‚Äôd upgrade the GPU/CPU every few years but the metal enclosure servers that were SMCI we rarely ever upgrade beyond 5+ years.  

PSA Don‚Äôt be their exit liquidity.  Lots of red flags, maybe you take a chance when it was $90 but at $1000 up 1000%  in a year and with all these red flags it‚Äôs a terrible investment."

Continuing the search for more insights into the current Semiconductor market, as posted in an earlier [Reddit-post](https://new.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0fhna/semiconductor_titans_visualized_a_chain_of/), I have come across an interested article with a more detailed breakdown from November last year.

Because I am not very familiar with the semiconductor chip industry, but have invested in various chip manufacturers in recent months, it seemed like a good idea to map out the chip manufacturing chain.  Interesting enough to share here since some, if not most, of the companies mentioned are discussed frequently here.

1273,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,T-Mobile US,42,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"
1274,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal‚Äôs Best Friend,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,80,55,05-05-2024 03:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cki4bo/elf_an_inflationfatigued_gals_best_friend/,"Gather round, friends. We‚Äôre cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

Enovix announced it has been granted 15-year Pioneer Status from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, MIDA, for manufacturing its batteries in Malaysia. Effectively this is a tax abatement. 

Site Acceptance Testing will be complete during 2Q24.

Minimum throughput for Gen 2 is 1350 units per hour is confirmed but they already tested at 1650 units per hour.

Signed a development agreement with a top 5 cellphone OEM.

Sampling to 6 of 8 top cellphone OEMS.

EX-1M w/ 18% more energy density vs graphite will ship 2Q24. EX-2M is expected to increase by 30% and will ship before year end 2024.

Anticipate further cost reductions of 35MM per year and Gen 2 cost will go down as more lines are added.

On the earnings call the Chief Financial Officer commented, they have a long runway before they‚Äôd need to raise capital and they wouldn‚Äôt do it at the current stock price. Nor would the board allow it.

He also mentioned they‚Äôve gotten unsolicited interest from governments and Sovereign Wealth Funds indicating a desire to provide funding if Enovix sets up a fab in their country.

Background:
I‚Äôve been in Automotive Sales for 4+ years. 
I have been in sales, finance and insurances.

2020-2023: If you work in the business then you recall during this time you could not even buy a lot of cars from auction due to getting outbid by Carvana and Carmax. They would go 1000-1500 over retail book value which already sets them back if they want to have volume based pricing. 

Carvana stated they averaged $6432 per copy. Now either they are straight up committing forcible sodomy on way too many people or they are full of üí©. I‚Äôm leaning towards the üí©. 

The average dealership should run 3000 a copy split between the front and back. A great dealership will run 4000-4500 a copy between the front and back. The front gross is determined by the sale of the vehicle and the back gross is your finance and insurances. 

Here is the catch. Book data on cars is still rough. Buying cars from the auction is STILL rough. Dealers are still paying a fair share of money just to acquire used cars. Carmax who is the number one automotive group in the country didn‚Äôt even put those numbers up. Yet Carvana is magically the highest grossing store per unit in the entire country. 

I‚Äôm considering going into a short position because this has fraud written all over it.

**Since my post SMTC has climbed almost 100%**

With a supreme confidence in Semtech being undervalued, I was anticipating that it would beat ER expectations by a mile and leap to $30+ from its current price at the time ($22 per share) due to extreme underestimations, I was wrong about Q4'23 ER numbers I will admit, but absolutely NOBODY on earth can tell me I was incorrect about the company being undervalued.   
  
I was fucking STUNLOCKED when they actually had slightly lower then expected numbers and I will hold the L for that, but due to good guidance what I am also holding is a **+400%** flip on my original position in total :) When the stock rallied pre earnings I was able to cover my cost basis, while still holding 30C's which I then sold the week after ER.

 My plan is to take a portion of my gains and double down on long calls / leaps to sit on for a deeper timeframe, this recent push past the $35 level has my confidence at ATH for the long-term. Now trying to wait for a red day to hop back in which has been rare. ( currently **$38.68** per share )

On the horizon for Semtech I truly believe in the possibility of an acquisition, and the capabilities of IoT/LoRa technology & data center enterprise computing to help fuel the AI / Tech abundant future. Hedge funds are starting to notice it and I hope anyone who read my post and believed in it being undervalued made a massive bag, and I pray that by writing this one I can help deliver more pickle's to come.

Doing my dd, it seems to me that the price of cocoa will significantly impact Hershey's earnings, and if it doesn't, the guidance call will probably be ass.

For reference Mondelez MDLZ, also a [player](https://www.mondelezinternational.com/our-brands/) in the confectionaries, is trending down, they did beat expectations, but they had higher that expected expenses, and it doesn't seem cocoa prices will resolve quickly. Mondelez has tried to get ahead of it with a 2 years pricing for cocoa locked in, and the stock still getting destroyed, kinda.

Hersheys is in a more difficult situation. Unions have them by the balls, a not insignificant factor in their overall expenses. Most of their [brands](https://www.thehersheycompany.com/en_us/home/brands.html) are chocolate ~~based~~ infused, basically their exposure to chocolate is a lot bigger than Mondelez. Consumer pull back on spending, and to make it worse, the US isn't exactly known for its consumption of chocolate Per Capita, I don't think we are in the top 5. Meaning, it s far easier for an average person to forego chocolate, especially if the prices for it to go up.

To summarize, high cocoa prices, wary consumer, high expense for Hersheys might lead to some downbeat guidance, maybe earnings mis. By how much I don't know, its smooth brain maths in here.

SInce this is not a DD, go do the research.

I am buying a put. A single put. But I would like to hear what you guys think.

April 29,2024

https://www.cnbc.com/2024/04/29/bernstein-says-be-like-buffett-and-buy-apple-shares-while-they-are-cheap-upgrades-to-outperform-.html

Bernstein upgraded shares of Apple
on Monday, saying they had fallen too far on fears of sluggish iPhone 15 sales and overall weak revenue in China. 

The firm, which has been on the sidelines for Apple with just a market perform rating for more than two years, advised investors to ‚Äúbe like Buffett‚Äù and scoop up the shares while they are cheap.

Bernstein upgraded Apple to outperform from market perform and kept its $195 price target, representing 15% upside from here. 

The stock is down 12% this year, compared to a 6.9% gain for the S&P 500, over fears that it is losing market share in China amid further restrictions by the government there.

Bernstein notes that following this year‚Äôs losses, Apple is trading at a price to earnings ratio of 26.4 based on its 2024 earnings estimate and just 22.9 times its 2025 estimate. Bernstein displayed a table in the note to clients that shows Buffett tends to trim the shares when its price to earnings ratio gets above 30 and he buys more during quarters when the valuation is around the current range.

We believe prevailing weakness in China is more cyclical than structural, and note that historically Apple‚Äôs China business has exhibited much higher volatility than Apple overall, given its very feature-sensitive installed base,‚Äù stated the analyst.

 ‚ÄúWe further believe that replacement cycle tailwinds and incremental generative AI features set up Apple well for a strong iPhone 16 cycle

Calling it very bullish.

And this.

Cramer says Apple‚Äôs Monday rally doesn‚Äôt have ‚Äòstaying power‚Äô after analyst upgrade

And yet the put call open interest ratio for May 3,2024 contracts are at the 0.58 level or definitely bullish.

Calls it is ?

The decrease in China sales is already priced in the stock. So even if they mention a decline in China sales the stock could still bounce if guidance and earnings are good.

Narrow earnings beat, moderate to strong guidance because of the iPad refresh coming shortly after.
Artificial Intelligence will be mentioned.

It‚Äôs all about the guidance .

1285,NYCB Terrible Earnings,wallstreetbets,T.

So recently to save the bank from failing shareholder got diluted 70%+ with more dilution on the horizon via warrants. That dilution itself would be sufficient explanation for its current price. Instead they posted an all time terrible 4q2023 earnings. 

Well 1q2024 is in and it‚Äôs bad. Excluding write downs losses accelerated from 187 million to 327 million q/q or a jump of 75%. I guess all of that dilution saves you so eps is only a loss of 45c share.  Worst of all that‚Äôs a loss of 45c per share after selling their best loans meaning losses next quarter are almost guaranteed to be worse. Net interest income down 16% q/q. Net interest margin down 54 basis points q/q (that‚Äôs a 20% NIM drop in a single quarter). 27% Revenue drop q/q and 76.2% drop y/y.   Non interest income went from 127M last quarter to 9M this quarter. Non performing loans jumped 86.5% q/q. Allowance for credit losses jumped 21% q/q.

Overall these are terrible numbers but to have this bad of a q/q results after an all time bad quarter is scary so they need to show those losses decelerating very soon otherwise anymore capital flight and they could go under. I don‚Äôt personally expect them to fail but if you have shares I‚Äôd use any low volume pre market pump to get out. This isn‚Äôt a short squeeze opportunity and they just proved the road to meeting even yesterday‚Äôs valuation is probably over 2 years away. Be wary I‚Äôve seen plenty of big pops on earnings before the market opens evaporate when real investors start selling at open.

Edit: One last thought. It to me feels shady that they really rushed this earnings (13 hour notice) into the morning of an fomc meeting. This is most likely because many regionals used the most rosy legally allowable prediction of two rate cuts in their 2024 forward looking statements and I‚Äôm sure Otting wanted to do the same instead of waiting a week or 2 and having to be only able to factor in one or zero. That‚Äôs a huge impact to net interest income. "

1) The Fed has no reason to fuck with us this year.  The Chicago Purchasing‚Äôs Manager Index has fallen for five straight months in a row. Lowest since November 2022.  Manufacturing is slowing fast.  JPOW & company needs to calm the markets on Capitol Hill today.

1287,One of these chips is not like the others‚Ä¶ Laying the bull and bear case for NVDA,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,13,19,01-05-2024 04:17:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chd3ny/one_of_these_chips_is_not_like_the_others_laying/,"TLDR at the top.

Chicago Bears case:
1. General market uncertainty. SPY facing resistance
2. Geopolitical threats in the form of Chinese aggression to Taiwan and sanctions from US

Chicago Bulls case:
1. Most explosive growth of any company, growing revenue and profit almost 20% Q/Q over the past year
2. Strong future demand, first to market advantage with no immediate threats
3. The chart and timing of May 22nd earnings. 
4. Shorts can‚Äôt help themselves trying to call crash

My positions:
Jan2025 1000c
May 24 950c

The bear case is self explanatory so I will not go into much detail. 
We are coming to the end of a massive QE cycle and almost everyone has lost spending power. Money is tight which risks a broad market sell off. I will look for more bank failures home and abroad to signal a short term dump. 

A significant threat from China would shake everything TSM touches. Right now we see posturing from the CCP and the occasional show of aggression when the politics call for it, but no signs of imminent invasion yet. 

The bull case is simply bulletproof. Breaking down the above points below: 

The earnings are in. AMD revenue has been flat for 3-4 years and they are supposed to compete with NVDA? They are not in the same league - no one is. NVDA is the only mega cap stock putting up these kind of numbers. Speculation is a bull‚Äôs best friend, and the trajectory is unparalleled with this stock. 

Cryptocurrency mining is not going anywhere, and it just got more expensive to mine after the latest round of BTC halving. More computing power = more revenue for miners and this market competition will intensify. NVDA price seems to correlate with BTC but the crypto mining revenue stream is consistent. The other revenue stream is of course AI applications in which an arms race is taking place. 

The psychology of us ‚Äòinvestors‚Äô is mostly really stupid, but the buzz matters. This is the only company anyone is excited about. Market makers know this and they know they can fetch a high price when earnings rolls around. The chart is set up for new heights with the dip bought within a week. I plan on holding my jan2025c through earnings. NVDA for the past year has beat the seemingly aggressive expectations it sets for itself. They say 24B revenue this quarter but I think closer to 27B. Let the speculation begin. It will be interesting to see if we get another dip before a significant event like last earnings feb 2024 and GTC meeting March 18. If so, I buy more.

Good luck everyone! Don‚Äôt do anything impulsive or regarded and please add your disrespectful bear and bull thoughts in the comments. "

It‚Äôs why basically every single time the market expected a dump due to CPI or PPI or some other FOMC meeting that bears love to play with their dongs over, no crash happened.

In fact, the moment a supermarket raises the price of any item, that information is feeded instantaneously and automatically to algorithmic trading bots of hedge funds. It‚Äôs always priced in. 

The dump already happened yesterday. In fact, even a rate hike is already priced in by the futures markets. If news articles are talking about a potential rate hike, you think the markets haven‚Äôt taken it into account? Good night and see you tomorrow. I expect to wake up to many things rising

I'm noticing that when Netflix makes this ""nail"" shape (I'm not well-versed in technical analysis) on a red day, the following trading day, the stock has a very good day.

Look, I know all you downy looking regards are very talented at losing money,  but if you want to actually try **making** some money for once, I‚Äôll let you in on some of my cooking üç≥

Okay great, the reason for the post today, is that something **just** came across my desk and it is perhaps the **best** thing I've seen in six months.

For all you uneducated burger flippers, let me tell you about CPNG (Coupang) a growing Korean e-commerce company. After taking a look at the charts on my robinhood app, I could tell that this stock has **HUGE** upside potential with **very little** downside. Their earnings are on **May 7th** and it could easily be one of those rare 1**0 baggers** we get every so often. üí∞x10

The fair value for CPNG is estimated at $32.41 based on the 2 Stage Free Cash Flow to Equity model. Meanwhile, it's trading at a measly $22.91. That means this stock is undervalued by a staggering 30% meaning it can moon, HARD. üåï üöÄ

For the intellectually challenged among you, let me explain the Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) model to explain why I think this is. üß†üí°

Let‚Äôs Project CPNG's future free cash flows (FCF) for the next 10 years:

I‚Äôm not going to explain how inflation works to you poors, but generally, money is more valuable today than in ten years. Bottom line, you discount the value of these future cash flows to their estimated value in today's dollars:

https://preview.redd.it/7wdna9rphwwc1.png?width=2636&format=png&auto=webp&s=73befba8f4425a925cad0208c5fd71579c707c20

**Present Value of 10-year Cash Flow (PVCF)** = US$18b

Next is what you call Terminal Value, this is the business's cash flow after the first stage. The Gordon Growth formula is used to calculate Terminal Value at a future annual growth rate equal to the 5-year average of the 10-year government bond yield of 2.3%. Now discount the terminal cash flows to today's value at a cost of equity of 7.1%.

\*\*Terminal Value (TV)\*\*= FCF2033 √ó (1 + g) √∑ (r ‚Äì g) = US$3.7b√ó (1 + 2.3%) √∑ (7.1%‚Äì 2.3%) = US$79b

\*\*Present Value of Terminal Value (PVTV)\*\*= TV / (1 + r)10= US$79b√∑ ( 1 + 7.1%)10= US$40b

Crunch the numbers and add up all the present values of CPNG's future cash flows, which gives us a total equity value of $58 billionüí∞üí∞üí∞

Now, here's where it gets juicy. Take that $58 billion and divide it by the number of shares outstanding and you will get $32.41.

Compared to the current share price of $22.91, and you'll realize this stock is undervalued by a whole 30%! üìà

Now, I know some of you are probably trembling in your Crocs, afraid to take the plunge. But **guess what**, betas don‚Äôt make money, they just choose a nice ETF like VOO after paperhanding on options **once**.

So, here's the deal. CPNG is practically begging you to buy it at this massive discount. Don't be a wimp, grab some calls and strap in, because this rocket is about to blast off to the moon, and leave you whining about how you can't achieve generational wealth.

TLDR; CPNG is undervalued by 30%, you neckbeards. If you don't go all-in right now, you'll be stuck working at Wendy‚Äôs while the rest of us count our tendies üí∞üçü

I don't even know a lot about BABA. I mean, it's some kind of shitty Chinese Amazon, right? But instead of trading at forward P/E of fucking 40, it trades at 8x earnings. How do I know that this will normalize? I fucking don't! I don't even know if those numbers are accurate. No one does.

I know it has a lot of cash. Like, a ridiculous amount of cash in proportion to its market cap. It could probably use that cash to increase the share price.

Who cares?

I also know that its valuation has nothing to do with its financials and is entirely based on risk. Geopolitical risk, internal anti-monopoly political risk, tariff and cold war bullshit risk, Chinese economic stagnation risk. Are these real tangible threats to the forward value of Alibaba? I don't know, maybe. Probably. But WGAF?

What matters in investing is stories. A good story wins hearts and minds. And wallets. And Chinese companies, especially BABA, are the most beaten down and unloved garbage on the entire fucking planet. While the whole world rallied around, I don't fucking know, AI or soft landings or things generally not being quite as shitty as everyone expected, China equities have been shittier than anyone has ever seen. Ever. So what am I proposing? A story. A beautiful, heartwarming story. An underdog tale.

1301,FANG - The Hidden Gem in the Oil Patch About to Explode? üöÄüöÄ,wallstreetbets,T.

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

1. **Capital Expenditures** - Meta is ramping up its investment in AI, raising its 2024 spending forecast to $35 billion to $40 billion, up from $30 billion to $37 billion. They're betting big on future tech.

2. **Revenue Forecast** - For Q2, Meta expects revenue between $36.5 billion and $39 billion. The midpoint, $37.75 billion, represents an 18% year-over-year increase, though it's slightly below the average analyst estimate of $38.3 billion.

Here‚Äôs the thing on IV crush - it will always beat at least one side to a pulp. META moves 10% up, puts get hammered. 10% down and calls see life savings go to $0. Moves 2-3% BOTH sides suffer.

So why not play $SNAP instead? 

Benefit is you still have high IV leading into their ER, their stock price will follow META‚Äôs news and you can close out before you face the subsequent crush of IV on Friday morning.

I only bought \~30 shares (DCA from 160 to 140, with average price \~150) because I was waiting for it to get to $120, but I guess if everyone wants it at $120 it won‚Äôt go to that price. Anyways, a lot of people seem to be upset that Tesla did not nosedive after the well-expected horrible earnings but Tesla can be very good stock at current price for two reasons.

1. I believe humanoid robots will be one of the most important technology of this decade and Tesla is at the forefront. Tesla is the only company (other than Hyundai probably) that has mass production experience and technology to make humanoid robots. Good engineers still prefer to work at Tesla than other manufacturing companies. For example, last time I checked around 2023, most of the PhD students from top robotics lab at UCLA went on to work at Tesla. The AI development for robots will probably be easier than robotaxi because there is much larger margin of error (not moving at 100mph, mostly controlled environment). If they announce something like ‚Äúcommercial robots at factories 202X and at homes 202(X+P) for $Y0,000,‚Äù the stock price can go $300s.
2. Tesla is considered to be very interest rate sensitive. There was a lot of fear that US inflation just will not come down (some even suggesting that the Fed will raise rates). But PMI result that came out yesterday morning was much better for inflation than expected. Tesla stock can pop with rate cut.

  
I agree with bears (and have been Tesla bear) that much of the stock price already priced in Tesla‚Äôs dreams. However, even if none of their dreams come true, Tesla will probably be $120 around 2026 where as the upside is massive.

P.S. With that said, I have following bearish points just to summarize my thoughts.

1. EV is inferior product for consumer experience compared to ICE for most people unless autonomous driving or solid-state battery become available. People make analogy of ICE-to-EV to 2G-to-smartphone but I wonder if these people actually have ever been on road trips with EV.
2. Robotaxi with vision-only might never happen. The AI issue of robotaxi is very different from generative AI as generative AI is almost expected to be wrong much of the times whereas robotaxi cannot be wrong ever. It is a tail-end, rare-event problem. People assume that Tesla will be the only one to solve robotaxi because they have more data than others, but I can make petabytes of data by copy-pasting some videos. What is important is the ability to reliably deal with long-tail problems, which might just require additional sensors. In that case, Tesla already sold FSD with promise of vision-only L4-5 technology. Are they going to recall them to add LIDARS? With that said, I am not expert in this field and have been wrong about capabilities of AI (didn‚Äôt expect a language model like ChatGPT happening so fast) so I could be wrong.
3. Many people price in SpaceX and Neural link into Tesla. As far as I know, these are separate companies."

IG reels is the only legitimate competitor to TikTok, and contrary to what some people have said here, the user base is actively growing. Given that earnings for META are also coming in, it‚Äôs time to buy calls. META has gone down over the last couple of weeks so this can‚Äôt be priced in either. The Senate wasn‚Äôt expected to pass this bill until the House decided to lump in the TikTok bill with foreign aid packages to fast track it.

Trump Media, which owns the Truth Social app, was trading at around $35 per share mid-day Monday.
April 22,2024

https://www.nbcnews.com/news/amp/rcna148847

Former President Donald Trump is poised to receive an additional 36 million shares of Trump Media Tuesday ‚Äî an ‚Äúearnout‚Äù bonus worth more than $1.25 billion, at Monday‚Äôs price.

That earnout is contingent on the benchmark being hit for 20 trading days within a 30-trading day period, beginning March 25,2024.

Tuesday is the 20th day and it is very unlikely that DJT will fall below the benchmark price of $17.50 per share by the end of that day.

The 36 million additional for Trump would be added to the 78.75 million shares he already owns, as the company‚Äôs majority shareholder.
Total of 114.75 million shares.

When the earnout shares are added to his existing stock, Trump‚Äôs total stake in Trump Media would be worth more than $4 billion on paper, at $35 a share.

The merged company, whose full name is Trump Media & Technology Group Corp., began public trading under the DJT ticker on March 26,2024 at an opening price of $70.90 per share.

That price rose to a high of nearly $80 that day, briefly giving the company a market capitalization of more than $9 billion.

Trump Media & Technology Group Corp. (DJT) is now $35.50 per share.

52 week high of $79.38
was on Tuesday,March 26,2024.
First day of trading under new name and stock symbol.

52 week low $12.40

The greatest show on Earth.

So let‚Äôs look back a little to understand more.

Trump Media stock jumps as much as 50% after DJT ticker debut,

This stock has had 4 major runs in 2024 lasting from 6 to 22 days.
Obviously,from all this recent activity,this stock is nowhere near finished for 2024.

Plan accordingly.
I wouldn‚Äôt be surprised to see at least 3 more runs before November 2024.

Trump stock and options are nowhere near finished.Not with an additional 36 million more shares for Trump.Not with an election coming up.

You cash out too soon and you miss out on those sweet-sweet tendies. You cash out too late and you‚Äôre filling out an application at Wendy‚Äôs. 

What we saw today was a major shift in sentiment among market makers. What should‚Äôve been a rebound off of the good news that neither Iran or Israel actually tried to inflict damage on one another, resulted in a steady crash across the market, with more markets makers net short than long for the first time in months. 

It‚Äôs only retail investors left who are net long than short and the MM‚Äôs are going to capitalize on this to profit off of us.

Given that earnings season is coming up (currently there is a black out period for orgs where they cannot participate in stock buy backs), there will be a boost driven by companies buying stock in the coming weeks before a sharp decline driven by market makers selling off to retail investors (as they have historically done during high interest rate environments).

Furthermore we see the elevated VIX indicating high volatility which has resulted in market makers reducing every rally we see, and the stocks continuing to drop.

With no interest rates coming this year, MM‚Äôs will continue to sell and short as most companies will fail to grow in a high interest rate environment due to cutbacks.

Only then will be see layoffs that will finally trigger the fed to cut rates. It presently won‚Äôt happen given that there just isn‚Äôt enough capital leaving circulation, and congress quite frankly does not want to do anything about it in the way of taxing it out of the bloated economy.

Hedge funds will act rationally and continue to net sell this year, reducing shareholder value, until they see a reason not to. It‚Äôs up to us to either sell, hedge, or get slaughtered in the process. The choice is yours.

During the euphoria phase, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see the major indices up 6, 7, 8 trading days in a row, while individual stocks are up 10, 11, 12, 13 days in a row. 

During the depression phase, it‚Äôs the complete opposite: the S&P 500 has sold off for 6 straight days, while many individual stocks e.g. Dave & Buster‚Äôs (PLAY) is down 12 days in a row, and Overstock/Beyond (BYON) has only had 1 green day w/minuscule gain in April thus far, following a 13-day losing streak.

It‚Äôs not just a matter of very high & very low RSI readings, but once the algos identify a trend, they seem to blindly follow it and squeeze out every last penny until they can‚Äôt anymore.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble, ie \~1995‚Äì2002, and to my surprise, this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive, but every few days, the trend would reverse. 

For example, Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3%, 4%, 1%, 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21, 1999, then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up, and on the way down, as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day, algo-driven markets."

prompted me to take a minute to explain. 

This is what you call ""mean reversion"".
If you flip a coin 100 times and it falls heads 100% of the time, it's still a 50-50 chance on the next flip to be either-or.

But if you flip that coin an infinite amount of times, it will be closer and closer to 50/50 with sometimes landing on the side.

If your expected average on the stock market is 8%, it doesn't mean that it will be a flat 8% return. Some years it'll be up, and some, it'll be down.

It can even have decades above or below that.

In the short-term, sentiment matters a lot, but in the long-run, fundamentals are all that really matters.

If earnings grow at a pace that justifies the increase in prices, the market will hold, but at some point they won't.

1315,PARA Thesis - No Deal and No Merger Outlook,wallstreetbets,T.

I am anticipating EPS of between $0.75 and $1.00 for Q1 2024 and forward guidance of $1B to $2B in earnings for 2024. I believe Paramount Global is trading at a discount when you factor EPS improvements from the last two quarters and trading at a 13x/14x PE on that basis. 

If we take away any deal aspect, Paramount is undervalued when compared to competitors. I would consider most competitors to be trading at a PE of 18x, while the industry average for the entertainment sector is 35x. Given market conditions, I would tie it to the PE of 18x which would be approximately an $13 near term price target and overall if forward guidance stays in line, a price target of $30 to $40 conservatively by 2025.

I think the reason for the discounted share price is shrouded by current deal talks with Skydance which would require some level of dilution for Paramount to acquire Skydance at a pretty ridiculous valuation of $4B to $5B. I‚Äôm fairly confident the Skydance deal won‚Äôt be reached if everything that has been reported as rumors is the entirety of the deal. I would paraphrase the DD talks between Paramount and Skydance going like this,

Paramount Special Committee: Why do you think Skydance is valued at $4B to $5B?

Skydance and Ellison: Because we said so.. 

Overall, bullish on Paramount. I think it‚Äôs trading in undervalued territory. Q1 earnings is coming early on April 29th by comparison to past reporting dates. Do with this what you will! 

Edit 1: To elaborate on the potential deal aspects, David Ellison is essentially trying to make a deal to acquire NAI and the PARA A shares from Shari Redstone. He is also wanting to merge Skydance and Paramount which most rumors reported it being dilutive to common shareholders and beneficial for Shari and/or all voting shareholders. He‚Äôs also trying to value Skydance at $4B to $5B based on funding raised, but in my opinion, if Skydance was listed publicly with current revenues, would get absolutely shit on at that valuation based on their revenue (not evening earnings). 

Apollo has submitted a $26B all cash deal for equity and debt and Byron Allen has discussed potentially a $30B all cash deal. Between the two, the average share price range for commons would be about $17 to $22 per share. 

Subscriptions for Paramount+ were growing steadily last year and Paramount per their last earnings forecasted profitability for their streaming segment by 2025. Overall, I think that Paramount could start selling off some of its linear elements and reduce debt as well throughout the year and improve valuation metrics pretty readily in that sense. It‚Äôs a dramatic story if you have been paying attention. "

In my opinion (and the opinion of Elon Musk who‚Äôs smarter than any of us) this is the right move.  The market is already flooded with cheap Chinese EVs and some used Teslas from the Hertz sell off.  Anyone who wants a cheaper Tesla can already get one. The real money is in the future with robotaxis.  The latest FSD v12 software update is incredible. My friend‚Äôs Tesla drives him all around Cleveland. He never has to take over the wheel.  The regulatory issues will probably be a problem. Especially if Biden is re-elected. The Biden administration hates Elon for exposing how partison and left leaning Twitter used to be.  But all these minor hiccups will eventually lead us to robotaxis.  I think in 5 years, you‚Äôll have Tesla robotaxis.  You‚Äôll open your Tesla app, order a ride, and it‚Äôll pick you up. Tesla makes a car for $20K. That car then picks up passengers* for nearly 24 hours per day (except when charging itself). That car could easily generate $50K annually. That‚Äôs a 2.5X annual return for every car they manufacture.
They made 1.85M cars in 2023. Up 38% YOY. If they can grow by 15% (far less than 38%), that's 7.5M cars in 10 years. Each car (robotaxi) generates $50K+ per year. That's $375M+ in revenue. It'd be a virtual cash machine valued (at the lowest) 5+ times revenue. That's at least a $1.875T Market Cap. Discount back 5 years at 7% rate and that‚Äôs 1.34T market cap, or a current stock price of $420 (how fitting).  Add a 30% margin of safety, and I‚Äôm buying this stock any price below $294.






MCD, SBUX
Honestly, both these companies are probably close to fairly priced, trading around 21X next year‚Äôs earnings.  But in a market where most stocks are overpriced, these two stand out.  And I‚Äôm willing to pay a premium for any company that I feel confident will be around in 30 years.  Equity in those kinds of companies act almost like stored value (like buying gold) because even if they stop growing, they will at least increase with monetary inflation.  But I think both have a lot of room to grow internationally.  I live in Peru, and both McDonald‚Äôs and Starbux are extremely popular with the locals.  Especially McDonald‚Äôs."

1318,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,201,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

1319,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,126,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/sec-filings/sec-filing/144/0001968582-24-000171

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

1320,Ford ($F) possible 20x bagger coming up ü§ë 4/24,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,0,211,17-04-2024 07:57:57,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c647hb/ford_f_possible_20x_bagger_coming_up_424/,"Hello Regards. Been trying to get the word out on Ford earnings for three days and keep getting my DD knocked down so here comes a long ass post in an attempt to get it to stick - because it ain‚Äôt no fun if the homies can‚Äôt have none!

**The Scoop:** Ford Motor Company, makers of EV‚Äôs, Hybrids and ICE cars has earnings coming up after market close on April 24th. 

Ford has been steadily gaining ground after a HUGE dropoff between Jan 2022 and June 2022 due to supply chain production issues and inflation worries that affected the entire auto industry. The stock is currently in an upward trend headed towards earnings and bounced off a major support around $12.

Most recently in Q1 2024 they touted that their Hybrid sales were up 42% representing the best quarter ever for them, supported by increased sales in almost all their other lines. Ford is also the #1 truck seller in America (F150). Additionally Ford is America‚Äôs #2 EV seller. They have a full lineup of vehicles, and have been around since dinosaurs walked the earth.

But here‚Äôs the kicker: While Tesla and other EV makers have been seeing their EV sales DECLINE, Ford has been seeing their EV sales INCREASE. With the transition from ICE to EV, this is very much a growth stock now, with **shitfucktons** of room to go. That‚Äôs a lot.

Ford‚Äôs F150 Electric Sales for instance were up +80% in Q1, this on the back of +74% sales in Q4 2023. And this isn‚Äôt even factoring in the 500k cars and 6.8% growth they saw in Q1 on all of their cars combined.

**Source:** This guy breaks it down even further here: 

https://youtu.be/ayWtbehZ8zg?si=Z-75W7Fd7MNxiVqb

**Main bullet points that got me in:**

*The Jan 2022 price was $25.87. Currently the price is $12.14. That‚Äôs a massive amount of growth potential on a seasoned Automobile stock that‚Äôs likely going to surpass the Jan 2022 price one day. 

*Short Float only 3.6% - Dirty hedge scumbags can‚Äôt tank this $10/share and you lose your entire ass in the blink of an eye.

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*Cybertruck FOMO - People priced out of Cybertruck that wanted an EV Truck can get an F150 Lightning for half the price of a CT, and not have to wait 3 years to get it. To me this is the strongest case. It‚Äôs like Meta‚Äôs Quest 3 vs Apple‚Äôs Vision Pro. Meta rode the coat-tails of Apple for one of the largest earnings rips of 2023, by providing the non-hype version of a product that does the same shit, and even does some shit better.

*Dirt Cheap Options for degens and regards. And Cheap Stocks for those a little less regarded. Currently $14.5-$15+ calls on 4/26 are $0.01 asks. If you look at the options chain, a big earnings beat and a $2 move means a 20x gain. A $3 move means your wife‚Äôs boyfriend will cry himself to sleep after he sees how big your newfound fortune is. You can buy him a Cybertruck that he‚Äôll get sometime in 2028.

*Huge Call OI - almost 65%

Source: WeBull Options Statistics tab

*55%+ Institutionally owned (Black Rock overlords holding with black diamond hands)

Source: https://finviz.com/quote.ashx?t=F&p=d#google_vignette

*EV Push + New Tesla Supercharger Access. Fords can now use Tesla Superchargers making charging a breeze.

Source: https://media.ford.com/content/fordmedia/fna/us/en/news/2024/02/29/ford-customers-can-now-charge-on-tesla-superchargers-in-u-s---ca.html

*Ford is a Boomer Dividend Stock. It‚Äôs a safety net and familiar. Barring a nuclear attack where stocks don‚Äôt matter and we‚Äôre all dead, a Middle East conflict may not affect this stock as much as other auto makers that are more reliant on foreign parts. Ford is not immune, but better off for sure.

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory:** Suspicious options chain with 45k $12.82c and 30k $13.82c expiring on 4/19. That‚Äôs a lot of calls this week with weird as hell strike prices and weird as hell open interest compared to other strikes, almost like somebody knows something üßê

**Bonus Conspiracy Theory 2:** Connected to the above, it‚Äôs possible Ford may announce a stock buy-back before or on the earnings call, which will raise the share price. So whomever is balls deep in those calls might still exercise them if they don‚Äôt hit by Friday. Perhaps that was their plan? The $12.82 looks good though IMO. I think $13 close by Friday looks good if there‚Äôs no WW3 market panic, which seems to be fading rn. 

Conclusion: 
Solid Automaker that‚Äôs not going anywhere. Risk-reward for both shares and options is HUGE on a big earnings beat. Boomer Divi stock that‚Äôs also now a growth stock. 

My Positions: 
$14.5c x100 - 4/26
$15.5c x26 - 4/26
$15c x150 - 4/26
$13.5c x23 - 5/3 

Snagging more in shares tomorrow if I can (waiting on a check lol)

Good luck ü§ëü§ëü§ë

So here is the thing. I‚Äôve been doing a lot of reading and listening on the topic of crypto, and it made me realize 2 things 

1. After the bitcoin halving, which btw is meant to be on 4/20, the yearly yield of bitcoin will be less than gold. This, for the highly regarded, means it‚Äôs going to be RARE. 

Rarity = scarcity
When something is scarce = demand 
demand = price go up ( big green )

2. Bitcoin follows a power law (picture of the graph)
For us regards, this means that bitcoin follows a trend line that is generated using functions of mathematical formulas. Not by human hands!
These lines have been very well respected by bitcoins price over the 15 year period. 
The way in which the accuracy of these lines can be measured is based on regression ( the r^2 number ). In the case of bitcoin and  this model, that number is .953, which means that it is 95.3% accurate. To add to this, the power law graphic of bitcoin has been the most accurate example so far‚Ä¶ out of any asset that has had power law applied to it. 

So why ramble about all this on here, and how does this relate to coinbase. Well if you look at the graph, we are very likely to expect a price of 150-200k in a years time,and a million in about 10. The reason I don‚Äôt believe that bitcoin is some sort of trend that will die out soon is because of the recent ETF adoptions of bitcoin. It‚Äôs here to stay. 

Coinbase is considered one of the biggest exchanges worldwide, second to Binance globally and 1st in the US. When it comes to users, it is second it Binance with a difference of 30 million, however it is a lot more user friendly when it comes to new users. With this information, imagine what is going to happen when bitcoin breaks all records and will go on to be talked about everywhere. The newbies are going to flock to coinbase and dump their savings into it, convincing their whole family to buy in at the family gatherings. 
Boomers are going to flock to the soon to be run, all through coinbase with its user friendly interface

Coinbase is a better platform for users who are simply looking for an easy place to buy and sell crypto, and those with simple trading requirements that don't need a wide range of trading tools. https://www.coinbureau.com/review/binance-vs-coinbase/#

To conclude. This is quite a long term play. Considering the -20% drop over the past couple days, and the halving coming up by the end of this week, it may be a good time to jump in. 

I‚Äôm full porting this one.
Best of luck my fellow regards. May your accounts be green and lambo‚Äôs in coinbase blue. "
1324,"$VFC : The North Face,Vans , Timberlands",wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,67,58,16-04-2024 00:16:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c525h5/vfc_the_north_facevans_timberlands/,"## The Turnaround Story

VF Corp is one of the world's largest footwear, apparel, and accessories companies. It owns a portfolio of highly iconic brands, including The North Face, Vans, Timberland and Supreme, brands that wouldn‚Äôt be unfamiliar to your average American.

VF-Corp

## The Fall from Grace

The stock has crashed 88% from its 2021 all-time high of $100 per share and is currently trading at $12 per share. What has changed,you may ask ? The sell-off can be attributed to all of these factors( in chronological order)  :

1. Early 2019, VF Corp sold of their denim brands (Wrangler and Lee Jeans, now known as Kontoor Brands) as they thought they weren't core to their brand portfolio. Kontoor Brands have since shown resilient growth on the top and bottom line.
2. Dec 2020, they did a $2.1 billion debt-financed acquisition of Supreme, which has since resulted in approximately 800-900 million in impairment cost, and the company has yet to succeed in monetise the Supreme brand and synergise it with their other brands.
3. Over-ordering of inventories during COVID-19, resulting in the need to sell their Vans/Timberland/Dickies inventory at a discount.
4. Throughout 2022 to late 2023, Vans' sales deteriorated 15% year-over-year in 2022 and a further 22% year-over-year in 2023, resulting in an accumulated decline of 35% from peak Vans sales.
5. March 17 2022, FED begins rate hikes to curb inflation. Borrowing costs increased from 0.25% in March 2022 to 5.25% in July 2023. This affected the cost of financing for VFC given their growing debt pile and market participants reflected this by discounting the stock price.
6. In Dec 2022, Steve Rendle, the CEO at the time made a sudden exit from the company during a time of deteriorating sales. Company lost its direction and an interim CEO had to be put in place.
7. After 7 months, in July 2023, a new CEO, Bracken Darrell (former Logitech CEO), was put in place tasked to revitalise the brands, but he subsequently cut revenue and earnings guidance, cut the dividend yield from 4-6% ish  to 0.9%, and declared multiple asset write-down. This further crashed the stock price, while the company announced the ""Reinvent"" program, a 4 year plan to bolster growth.
8. As of October 2023, VFC had become a debt-ridden company (7 billion in debt) with upcoming debt maturities to refinance, making it highly susceptible to interest rate fluctuations. The US 10-Year Yield at that time hit a 52-week high of 5% in October 2023, and the stock slid to $13 (-87% from ATH).
9. In April 2024, VFC was dropped from all S&P 500-related indices and the FTSE All-World Index due to its market cap falling into the small-cap category, further contributing to the slide in the share price.
10. On April 11, 2024, the Consumer Price Index (a measure of inflation) was higher than expected, pushing back the need for the FED to cut interest rates, and VFC's stock slid to a 15-year low of $12 per share, last seen during the 2018 Financial Crisis.  


## The Turnaround Opportunity

Despite the deteriorating sales, I believe the bottom is near, and the company has all the necessary components for a turnaround. 

Here's why:

## New CEO: Bracken Darrell

Bracken Darrell has an amazing track record in leading consumer product companies and elevating the consumer experience. He previously served as the CEO of Logitech for 10 years, during which time the share price increased tenfold. At Logitech, he strategically positioned the company into different markets, such as gaming (LogitechG) and video collaboration/live streaming tools, and oversaw the design of the most successful MX series. The tiny gaming business of Logitech, which started off at $40 Million grew to $1 Billion by the time he left. Logitech-MX series was founded during his tenure,Before Logitech, Darrell was at Procter & Gamble, tasked with rejuvenating the sales of Old Spice's (male grooming products) to appeal to a younger demographic, which he successfully did. Darrell has a strong track record with companies that have lost its footing and needs new product lines to rejuvenate growth. This time is no different.

## VF Corp's 5-Point Turnaround Plan: ""Reinvent"" 

VF Corp under Bracken Darrell announced a transformation plan called ""Reinvent"" which addresses shareholders top priorities and will focus on brand building and revitalizaiton. Here are the core issues to be addressed :

1. **Deliver a Vans Brand Turnaround**: Reset the brand's purpose, target audience, product plan, and marketing approach, and introduce new products and reset the marketplace in Q3 and Q4 of 2024.
2. **Fix the Underperformance in the Americas Region**: Establish a new commercial organization and regional platform, similar to the strategy used in the EMEA region, to improve results over time.
3. **Reduce Debt and Strengthen the Balance Sheet**: This is a top priority. VFC at one point racked up 6.5 billion in debt. In the most recent quarter, VF benefited from inventory reduction and a slashed dividend. They are already reducing net debt substantially and plan to monetize non-core physical assets to pay down upcoming debt without refinancing.
4. **Lower the Cost Base**: Deliver $300 million in fixed cost savings through simplifying and right-sizing the company's structure, selling real estate assets in Switzerland, and addressing other non-strategic areas.
5. **Strategic Review of the Brand Portfolio**: Sell off non-core brands, such as Kipling, Eastpak, and Jansport, that do not align with their long-term ambitions, to raise cash and pay down debt. VF Corp has 13 brands, and there may be other brands which will be sold.

## Recent Positive Developments

* Activist investors, such as Engaged Capital and Legion Partners Asset Management, own a significant stake in VF Corp, indicating their confidence in the turnaround potential.
* VF Corp reaffirmed its free cash flow guidance of $600 million, which is HUGE NEWS for a company in the midst of a turnaround. You need the Free Cash Flow to make due your payments.
* VF Corp recently collaborated with Dubai's GMG to open 200 more stores across Southeast Asia, North Africa, the United Arab Emirates, and the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia in the next 5 years, does this look like a company with deteriorating sales or a company ready to enter growth mode ?
* In their most recent quarter, the company has worked down inventories and significantly improved their cash conversion cycle, achieving positive changes in accounts receivable.

## Comparative Valuation Analysis

The North Face (TNF) brand, which is one of VFC's brands, alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue annually and is still continuing to grow.  


In comparison, Crocs, a footwear company with only two brands, generates $3.9 billion in revenue and has a market capitalization of $7.5 billion.  


VF Corp, with 13 brands, of which The North Face alone generates $3.6 billion in revenue, is trading at a market capitalization of only $4.7 billion. How is this $2.8 billion difference justified ?

Here's a DCF Model assuming first year 4% growth from this low base and 0% growth onwards of VFC's net income in perpetuity. This gives a share price of $21.00.

[https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true\&amp;headers=false](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/e/2PACX-1vSfVraRxX7JS6bAB9daSzm4wdFd0kwVMSWZ5khtvuSEzCwtiaIdfNOBcgPdFvSCYjGKoHVl6L72wT6J/pubhtml?widget=true&amp;headers=false)""  

Also assuming they return and maintain earnings at 1 billion and sticking an average 15x P/E would value them at a 15 billion market cap. Which is a 3x upside from here 

I'm looking to continue adding to this stock for the coming years. My fair value estimate assuming  3% growth and a 3% discount rate as rates fall, is $62, but  I do believe the company has what it takes to return to growth mode with new product lines like how New Balance and Abercome $ANF did. In that likely scenario, price target is >$100, but it's too far down the line to know as of now.   


Hope you guys enjoyed this DD, took me months to get everything sourced and organized ! Will make more of these in the future if people here like it.

Possible 25 Baggers"" AND ""PAA - Why it can go high, even if oil doesn't"") and I don't disagree with their logic of call leaps for '25 and '26. I bought $20C 8/16 and made a quick 330% profit, but the more I looked into midstream companies in 2024 I believe most are going to take a bit of hit in Q1 and Q2 before they start to climb. I think PAA could possibly be at $20 by the end of year, however based on several data sets and industry articles that I'm looking at I believe it's going to dip before it climbs in Q3 and Q4. That's why I think there are two ways this should be played. My current positions are listed at the end of this thread.

Midstream companies benefit when production is high. They have contracts in place with upstream companies, but these contracts are tiered based on production so to an extent these contracts protect them when production is down, BUT they do much better when production goes up based on the tiered structure of the contract.¬†Based on Frac Spread and Rig Count (see below) I have some concerns around production and how that will impact midstream companies in Q1 and perhaps Q2.¬†

**Frac Spread**

What is it? Measures the number of crews actively performing hydraulic fracturing of shale in the US. It's a leading indicator of oil production. Midstream companies, like PAA, thrive when production is high.There was an increase in fracture spread in February, but my concern is looking at Total Frac Spreads (Year/Year), 2024 compared to same time 2023. The decrease in Frac Spread in January and March of this year compared to last year is of concern and for the first two weeks of April this year. Production is way down compared to this time of year. Same with Rig Counts (see below)¬†Frac spread decreased by 227 compared to prior year, same quarter and decreased by 153 compared to Q4 2023.¬†

**Rig Count** 

What is it? Weekly number of drilling rigs exploring for or developing oil or gas in the US and Canada. Again, just like Frac Spread, there is a large variance of total rigs in 2023 compared to 2024.

Oil Prices Although oil prices are starting to climb in Q2, they were relatively low in Q1. Midstream oil companies typically do well when oil prices are high.

Again, I do believe that PAA could see $20 at the end of the year, but I think Q1 results are going to meh and potentially Q2. Keep an eye on frac spread, rig count, and oil prices. If all three start to increase then PAA will have a good year, but I'm skeptical on it until I see all three of those heading in a positive direction. AND I do believe all of those indicators (frac spread, rig count, and oil prices) will trend in a way that will benefit PAA stock price. I'm just not there yet.  I closed my shares a few weeks ago and I'm in on puts and then calls and shares it is when I start to see these numbers heading in the right direction. Leaps are still cheap but I'm waiting to see how much this goes down before buying calls to determine a strike price. ¬†This is not financial advice.¬†Just slightly (perhaps fully) regarded and how I think this will play out this year.

Elon got levered to his substantial tits through his Morgan Stanley bankers, borrowing against the value of his TSLA shares. Then he borrowed even more to buy Twitter, which he didn‚Äôt realize put all his wealth at stake until it was too late. So he tried to back out, but the courts said no. 

Now TSLA has declined by almost 50% from its peak, and oh yeah the Delaware court threw out his $55B pay package as unfair. So he doesn‚Äôt even have a lot of the shares he borrowed against, and the stock has tanked, and he hasn‚Äôt been able to get SpaceX public and he is fucked and all his shares will go to Morgan Stanley if the stock gets below the price on his margin loans. 

That price? $500. But it‚Äôs $165 you say! Yes, but back when you were in middle school the stock split 3 for 1. $500/3 = $166.66. 

The stock has never made it to the options close (which includes after hours) below $166.66. That‚Äôs because Elon and MS have defended it to avoid disaster. It is now below $166.66. 

Will it close below? I don‚Äôt know, but you can only defend a stock (probably by buying calls that force trading desks to buy stock to hedge, increasing your risk) for so long, and we‚Äôre one bad market day from the dam bursting. 

Long deep out of the money puts, short the stock, sell calls.

1330,TSLA earnings ,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,31,48,15-04-2024 02:13:27,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c4avx7/tsla_earnings/,"I see Tesla going either way, however I‚Äôm leaning towards the bearish side. Few statistics I found to make my decision. 

1- Their car delivery numbers were disappointing only delivering 386,810 cars versus analysts expected 433,371 representing a nearly 11% decrease QoQ. Even with the new cyber trucks their deliveries still plummeted, leading to a 9% drop in price. A as growing company not sure how they pulled of this of but very bearish. 

2- Teslas new car the Cyber truck has been incredibly underperforming and users say it‚Äôs dying way faster than it should especially when carrying large loads (what it‚Äôs designed for)
Edit: saw this right after postingüòÇ 
https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/E53YkLsAIE

3- We have seen a very slow EV market recently with most companies shares falling or just collapsing as a whole. Rivian and Lucid are on their way with Lucid only being held up by Saudi funding even with billions of net loss and debt. We saw Fisker declare bankruptcy. While Tesla is still leading this sector, EV is down 37% in the last year. This leads into my next point‚Ä¶

4- With the slow EV sector and many companies collapsing we still see a handful of companies going up and competing with Tesla. Such as Xiaomi which created a new car (comparative to teslas model 3) costing only 29,900 (nearly 10,000 less than the model 3). While Tesla reported poor sales, we saw BYD sell 300,000 cars in march versus 122,230 in January AND February. Li Auto delivered 4,400 more vehicles than its 76,000 Q1 estimate. Also EV companies have been changing the market. For example NIO announced a possibility to trade in gas cars for EV. BYD has been slashing prices and growing overseas sales. XPeng has doubled incentives on its SUV. And more. So with all these companies, succeeding why is Tesla lagging?

Now of course Tesla is not totally terrible. They have been pretty innovative recently too. 
 
1- They just announced the robo taxis coming in August of 24 which would open up a whole new branch for Tesla and increase profits (if it works). This isn‚Äôt all the new tech they are unveiling. They have released the cyber truck and semi truck along with having the model 3 be around 10,000$ cheaper than an average new car right now. These tech advancements are proving valuable for Tesla. 

2- I think this is the biggest bullish flag for Tesla. Their near monopoly on self driving and the tech that comes with it. I rememberer driving in one a few years ago and its auto pilot could only do highways. I drove in one the other day and it could do anything. Switched lanes at a light because it was 1 car faster. They are the main company when it comes to self driving and this is due to the 22.5 billion miles Tesla cars have driven. Every one of the miles is mapped out by Tesla to train its self driving. Other companies may and have tried to replicate this self driving, and while it may be easy to make it, the training is very difficult. Tesla has this training, however somewhat lacks in the tech industry compared to companies like Nvidia. Nvidia has a self driving sector however they and all other self driving companies need Tesla. For a complete self driving AI you need 3 things: hardware, software, and data. Nvidia has the hardware, Nvidia and Tesla have software, however only Tesla has the data. This shows their monopoly on the data portion and currently domination of self driving. I expect it to stay this way for a while and if they decide to partner up with say Nvidia, it‚Äôs even more bullish. 

3- One more factor I think could go either way is Tesla layoffs. They just announced potential layoffs of 20% of the workforce and we saw when Meta and Google did this shareholders loved it. However if they want to make their robo taxis they need more workers. On the other hand, might replace workers with robots. Kidding but I think this could be bearish or bullish. 

In conclusion I think Tesla is bearish for earnings due to deliveries and other EV companies still making it work in the poor markets while Tesla is not. However on the long term I see Tesla going back up to where it used to be as it dominates the self driving sector. What do you guys think?ü§î 

This is NOT financial advice but position are 4/26 150$ put and 8/16 75$ put for robo taxis most likely being delayed. Longterm just have shares. "
1331,Predicting SPX w/ Baccarat Board,wallstreetbets,T.

The results are quite interesting as a baccarat player.


The Blue Player wins are if SPX was up from previous day. Red Banker wins are if SPX was down from previous day. I did not put a threshold for ""ties"" or trim for any order of magnitude. So, if we were up merely 0.01% from previous day, that still counts as a Player win. For perspective, the absolute value of average 1D deltas this year was +/- 0.56%. 


So if I were to place some bets for the next 2 days (Monday and Tuesday), the bottom 2 rows on the bead plate chart (table on right) looks like strong pattern for Player to hit the next 2 days!

The caveat is that we were in a massive bull run so if we continue trending down, this wouldn‚Äôt be obvious here, but other charts indicate we‚Äôve got a bit more juice left for a week or 2 of upside before we crash 10% to sub $500 on SPY.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/jamesfarrell/2024/04/13/iran-seizes-ship-linked-to-israeli-billionaire-in-latest-escalation-of-tensions/

Iranian authorities seized an alleged Israeli-linked cargo ship near the Strait of Hormuz on Saturday morning, in the latest escalation of tensions between the two countries.

The MSC Aries is affiliated with Israeli businessman Eyal Ofer, chair of the Zodiac Group, which reportedly operates the ship.

Iranian forces conducted a helicopter operation to guide the ship to Iranian waters while carrying out an ‚Äúevacuation of personnel.‚Äù

Israeli Foreign Minister Israel Katz subsequently claimed Iran had seized ‚Äúa Portuguese civilian cargo ship, belonging to an EU member, claiming Israeli ownership,‚Äù and he accused Iran of ‚Äúconducting a pirate operation in violation of international law.‚Äù

FORBES VALUATION.We estimate the net worth of Eyal Ofer, the owner of the Zodiac group, at $24 billion, making him the 83rd-richest person in the world.

The vessel is operated by Geneva-based Mediterranean Shipping Company, the world‚Äôs biggest container shipping line. It is owned by Gortal Shipping, a finance company affiliated with Zodiac Maritime, a company controlled by Israel‚Äôs Ofer family.

Iran simply will not attack Israel directly as the US and Israel response would be measured and forceful.Iran has too much to lose to do so.They are crazy but not that crazy.

So Iran seizes an Israeli cargo ship with 25 crew members.This is the first indirect attack on Israeli assets on April 13,2024.What Iranian proxies do next should make for an interesting weekend.

Or as stated here.

Israel expects Iran to strike in a way that allows it to save face, but is measured enough to not arouse an even fiercer counterstrike, analysts say. 

The Iranians ‚Äúdon‚Äôt want a total war,‚Äù said Amos Gilead, a retired Israeli general. ‚ÄúSo they might attack targets that would enable them to declare that they‚Äôve achieved a great victory.‚Äù

No direct attacks from Iran are very likely.What are the next indirect steps by Iran,my fellow regards?

Regardless of what Iran does,Iran will benefit financially as it is the third largest oil producer among the 13 OPEC nations.It is in Iran‚Äôs best interest to keep oil prices elevated."
1334,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,645,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."

There has been some reporting on the issue, but mainstream analysis  of the trend is largely limited to the ""usual suspects"" - geopolitical  tensions (check), reckless and unsustainable government spending  (check), and fears about the banking system (check).

All these factors are absolutely relevant. But there is another huge factor entirely missing from the official story.

Gold and silver is traded in futures markets in NYC (COMEX) and London.

It is also traded in Shanghai on the Shanghai Metals Exchange.

Since around September of last year, **Shanghai has been paying a significant premium on gold (around 2%) and silver (around 8-10%).** Currently, silver in China is well over $30 an ounce.

Now, price spreads between COMEX and Shanghai Metals Exchange have happened before, but **never for so long and for so much**. (See Shanghai vs COMEX silver price chart here)

Arbitrage should have sorted this situation out by now. Let's ask ourselves why it hasn't.

Markets are carefully, and sometimes tightly, ""managed"" by the Chinese government.

For some reason, they are allowing their markets to pay more for gold and silver than the American and UK markets. **This effectively allows** **China** **to set the price for precious metals and slurp up global supply**,  as miners in South America, Mexico, Poland, South Africa ect. can  simply sell their gold and silver to China instead of America.

This is likely an intentional gambit by the Chinese government. It is  probably related to geopolitical tensions between America and China,  and Chinese fears that the American government will weaponize the dollar  to undermine Beijing's interests. 

Raw data on Shanghai silver prices is available here: [https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj](https://www.sge.com.cn/sjzx/shyjzj) (Note, these are in yuan/kilo, so math is required to figure out the corresponding COMEX prices).

1337,üöÄüåï SOFI: The Sleeper About to Blast Off! üåïüöÄ,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,76,131,11-04-2024 18:42:26,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c1mp2m/sofi_the_sleeper_about_to_blast_off/,"Listen up, degenerates and fellow regards of WallStreetBets, it‚Äôs time to tune into a stock that‚Äôs been flying under the radar but is primed to make some seismic waves. I‚Äôm talking about none other than SOFI Technologies, Inc. (Ticker: $SOFI). Here‚Äôs why your portfolio needs this rocket fuel, especially with their earnings announcement on April 29th that‚Äôs expected to be a monumental blowout, continuing their streak of outperformance.

**üî• The Lowdown on $SOF**I:

**- Mid-Cap Maverick with Mega Growth:** Clocking in with a market cap of $7.38B and trading at a savory $7.56 a share, SoFi ain‚Äôt no small fry. With 959 million shares out there, this company‚Äôs financial growth spurt is just getting started. Revenue shot up 300% from $560M to a whopping $2 billion! If that doesn‚Äôt scream growth, I don‚Äôt know what does. Did I mention they‚Äôre forecasting upwards of $.80 EPS in 2026? ü§Ø

**- Financials on Fire:** Despite Wallstreet neglecting SoFi‚Äôs positive free cash flow and positive GAAP earnings in Q4 and going forward, this beast is about evolution. With lending, financial services and a proprietary technology platform driving a revenue rocket, this puppy is set to print some serious tendies for those with the cajones to hold. Especially when that revenue is launching faster than a SpaceX test flight.

**- Industry Underdog Ready to Lead the Pack:** In a sea of 56 companies, SoFi stands out with its beyond-undervalued metrics - Price to Book, PEG, P/E, etc. despite its high growth trajectory. And let‚Äôs not forget, while banks spend billions on dying brick-and-mortar locations, SOFI‚Äôs lean model means more fuel for the growth rocket without the dead weight.

**- Membership and Product Growth Off the Charts:** SoFi achieved strong year-over-year growth in both members and products in the fourth quarter and full-year 2023. New member additions of nearly 585,000 in the quarter brought total members to over 7.5 million by year end, up over 2.3 million, or 44%, from the prior year end. With product usage booming and new members flocking, it‚Äôs like every quarter is Black Friday but without the discount because SOFI doesn‚Äôt need to cut prices to attract the crowd. Did I mention they‚Äôre now the official bank sponsor of the NBA? Hmm‚Ä¶I‚Äôd bet my wife‚Äôs boyfriend‚Äôs car that we hit record new members this quarter.

**- Earnings Explosion Incoming:** Mark your calendars for April 29th because SOFI‚Äôs about to drop their earnings like a mic at a rap battle. Year after year, they‚Äôve been knocking expectations out of the park, and this year‚Äôs going to be no exception. Get ready for a blowout that‚Äôll have Wall Street's jaws on the floor.

**üåü Why $SOFI is Your Ticket to the Moo**n üåü

**- Blowout Earnings Anticipated:** The word on the street (and by street, I mean the data-driven corridors of finance nerds) is that SOFI is about to blow the roof off with their upcoming earnings. They‚Äôve been beating expectations like it‚Äôs their job (well, it kinda is), and April 29th is going to be a show you don‚Äôt want to miss.

**- Rapid Growth in a Booming Sector:** Financial tech isn‚Äôt just the future; it‚Äôs the now. SOFI, with its digital-first approach, is poised to dominate. Membership growth, product expansion, and strategic acquisitions like Galileo signal a company on the move, not content with playing second fiddle. It‚Äôs a matter of time before their tech platform takes off. They have a deep pipeline and have a top 5 US bank \*\*cough\*\* CITI Bank \*\*cough\*\* going through a proof of concept. They‚Äôre being overly conservative with their 20-25% annual tech revenue growth.

**- Valuation Vindication on the Horizon:** This is like paying $.30 for $1. Bargain hunting baby.

**üîÆ Conclusion: Don‚Äôt Sleep on SOF**I üîÆ

In the world of stocks, SOFI is that hidden gem, glittering in the rough, waiting for the discerning eye to recognize its inherent value. With explosive growth, industry-leading metrics, and an earnings report poised to shatter ceilings, SOFI isn‚Äôt just a good investment; it‚Äôs a portfolio cornerstone for those looking to ride the next wave of financial innovation.

So, strap in, fellow WallStreetBets warriors. It‚Äôs time to add some SOFI to your stock arsenal and prepare for lift-off. The countdown has begun, and April 29th is just the beginning. To the moon, SOFI! üöÄüåï

1339,"Listen up regards, CPI lesson incoming",wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,0,67,11-04-2024 04:58:04,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c16n9h/listen_up_regards_cpi_lesson_incoming/,"Look, all of these people on here don‚Äôt seem to understand how the CPI is bullshit and are saying how rare cuts are never gonna happen until 2025. But let me paint you a different picture.

Yes the CPI came in technically hotter than expected, but when you actually dive into the numbers, it tells a different story. The main 3 factors that are causing this higher than 2 percent inflation are 
1. Shelter
2. Electricity 
3. Transportation

Now we‚Äôll look at each individually:
1. Shelter: shelter is calculated on a ‚Äúrenters equivalent‚Äù bullshit term made up to try and fudge the numbers on what people actually pay, but for this explanation, it‚Äôs not that important. What IS important is the fact that shelter is a lagging indicator. When the interest rate hike takes effect, most people don‚Äôt feel the immediate impact of this. Renters have to go through their lease period before rent is raised, and like 80 percent of mortgages are fixed rates so most home owners don‚Äôt feel it either. So shelter being at around 6% is actually the effects of the rate hikes at least 12-18 months prior to this date.

2. Electricity: despite the price of natural gas, coal, and renewable energy all becoming significantly cheaper in the last 4 years, energy prices are up. The only possible explanation to me is profiteering, because there is no reason why with all three of these commodities being so low should electricity be this high. 

3. Transportation: despite its name, one of its largest components is actually car insurance, which has miraculously increased by like 20% yoy because of their ‚Äùfuture modeling‚Äù predicting higher costs to them, which ended up being false. If you check Geico‚Äôs recent quarterly statement, they said they actually had lower costs this year on average. So once again, profiteering.

In the end keeping interest rates high is actually hurting the CPI more by keeping mortgages higher which then translates to higher shelter. Without these 3 CPI numbers, (one of which is a. Lagging and b. Held higher with higher rates while the other two are from profiteering), inflation is already below 2 percent.

TLDR: fed keeping rates higher for no reason because the real data says otherwise "

I‚Äôve been diving deep into the options market and found what seems to be an overlooked opportunity with SWAV (Shockwave Medical, Inc.). After Johnson & Johnson announced acquiring SWAV for about $12.5-$13.1 billion, setting each share price at $335, it‚Äôs intriguing to see SWAV‚Äôs shares hovering around $328-$329  .

This situation seems particularly interesting for the 4/19 $330 calls. Considering the acquisition price and SWAV‚Äôs current trading price, these calls appear to be trading at a bargain. Currently up 325% today with just an increase of 0.7% in the stock price. With just a slight uptick of 1-2%, these options could see significant gains.

The minutes from the Federal Open Market Committee (FOMC) meeting on March 19-20, 2024, reveal a cautious outlook on the economy and inflation in response to recent economic developments, including higher Consumer Price Index (CPI) figures.

Key highlights from the minutes include:

- Economic Growth and Labor Market: The U.S. economy was expanding at a solid pace, albeit slower than in the previous quarter. The labor market remained strong, with demand and supply moving into better balance, even though certain sectors and areas reported very tight conditions. The committee noted strong payroll growth and low unemployment rates, alongside signs of easing labor market conditions, such as declining job vacancies and a lower quits rate.

- Inflation Concerns: The committee observed significant progress towards the 2 percent inflation objective, yet recent months showed firmer than expected inflation readings, indicating a more complex disinflation process. The persistence of high inflation and its adverse effects on households were highlighted, along with a broad-based increase in recent inflation readings.

- Monetary Policy Stance: All participants agreed to maintain the target range for the federal funds rate at 5¬º to 5¬Ω percent, citing it as supportive of progress towards returning inflation to the 2 percent objective. The stance on monetary policy was deemed likely at its peak for this tightening cycle, with most participants anticipating a move to a less restrictive stance within the year if the economy evolved as expected. Nonetheless, the committee stressed the need for further confidence that inflation was sustainably moving towards the 2 percent target before considering rate reductions.

- Risks and Uncertainties: There was considerable discussion around the uncertainties and risks facing the economy, including geopolitical risks, financial conditions, productivity growth, and the impact of recent immigration trends on labor supply and economic activity. The balance of risks to the employment and inflation goals was seen as moving into better balance, although careful monitoring of incoming data and a readiness to adjust policy as needed were emphasized.

In summary, the FOMC minutes reflect a cautious but hopeful outlook on the economy, with particular attention to the challenges of managing inflation back to the 2 percent target. The committee's decision to maintain the current federal funds rate range underscores its commitment to stabilizing prices while being ready to adapt its policy stance in response to new economic data."
1342,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,58,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

1343,Depressing Story to Figure out,wallstreetbets,T.

The company I‚Äôm talking about is ‚ÄúGreenwave Technology solutions.‚Äù At first I was going to make a bait thread where I fucking edited the price of the stock out and only showed how many shares I owned and once you guys searched up the ticker symbol you‚Äôd fucking laugh your asses off or something lol. But while I was reading their financial statements I did get a bit curious about them, they had less than 10 thousand dollars in net revenues a couple years back, and were taking some serious financial losses even then. It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner, this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do, especially when shit hits the fan, so yeah, I respected that a lot. The company is a small business, it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market, neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them, thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, especially after corona. It hurts me even more since my father is a truck driver, my hats off to the guy, even if I feel like the financials look kind of like doo doo (negative cash flow üíÄ) I like this dudes drive and because of that I like the stonk. üòé"
1344,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,41,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

Rowe Price,288,431,08-04-2024 23:44:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzddvu/paa_why_it_can_go_higher_even_if_oil_doesnt/,"This is a long term play (at least through the summer and into US elections).  If you are trying to trade every few days at the bid/ask with more than a handful of contracts, you are leaving a bunch on the table and getting screwed by the spread.  PAA gets paid based on oil volume (NGL is hedged) so the play here is the econ forecasts were low, oil demand forecasts were low, other factors will limit supply, and  options buying requires some hedging on what is a normally low vol options stock.

I was originally inspired by the DD in ‚ÄúDrill Baby Drill‚Äù to look into PAA.  While I thought his reasoning of ‚Äúwhy‚Äù the options were cheap was off a bit (its a divi company, that's partly why they are so cheap) - upon further looking into it I agreed based on the following and jumped on 3/28 in the afternoon with more purchases subsequently.  This was originally started last week but did not get out until Monday after close due to some family items.  (Originally I said I would be happy with $19 by end of April and ecstatic with $19.5 as this is a slow bleed up play)

I have \~2.500 contracts of varying strikes through 2026.  I will not look to exit until around elections or end of year **by exercising** (not selling as MMs are low balling bids).

I will attach some screenshots of PAA Q1 2024 investor presentation from:

In general, the thoughts are this:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines** - good locations for non sanctioned oil demand (US and Canada)

**Crude & NGL** - NGL is 90% hedged.  Most crude in the US is from the Permian, where their pipelines are. 85% of their EBITDA is tied to crude. OECD inventories are at multi year lows.

**Volume play** - demand is going to increase more than anticipated, leading to substantial more volume in their pipelines (economies are better than anticipated, oil is higher than thought, location location location, etc)

**PAA earnings assumptions** - PAA assumed $75 average cost of oil per barrel (Q1 investor presentation) for earnings, which we crossed mid march, we are going to get better forward guidance.  See price of PAA since mid march as well.

**PAA Permian Pricing Contracts -** PAA have not updated their pricing for Permian since October or earlier last year, maybe with higher oil we get higher fees they can charge on trunking/gathering further boosting earnings.

**Dividend -**  Most traditional buyers of Oil/Gas are dividend guys. (Yes technically this is RoC) They are happy with 7% a year.  PAA diverged from ET/EPD etc a \~+7% since 3/28 when we all bought options. These divi guys might jump ship to PAA leading to more demand for stock and driving up prices.

**‚ÄúUndervalued‚Äù -**  Well the concept of undervalued always rubbed me wrong (I prefer incorrectly valued based on faulty assumptions) The market already had PAA up by \~50% over trailing 12 months prior to our 3/28 options buying.  Summer before covid it was $24+.

**PAA Army**

**Options buying -** Most options are LEAPs in 2025/2026 and there are a shit ton compared to normal.  In a nostalgic review of the history of a certain stock I was reminded it got kicked off originally with long dated calls and subsequent hedging with upward price movement.  While there will be no short squeeze (its the least shorted stock of its peers), we might be able to get some gamma action from the delta hedging as we overloaded the normal call volume by a ton.  This is also why ET/EPD etc **will not see the same price action regardless of oil surging.  Its all of the other reasons +  options buying that is the recipe for this cake.**

**Delta Hedging -** Unless we are buying covered calls from the institutions holding PAA (unlikely but is good regardless as they want the price to increase as well), the MMs will likely delta hedge the long dated call options by buying more stock.  (This is why we seem to spike and then trade in a range for the day, they sell when its too high, and buy when its too low.  It could also explain why we tend to end the day in the highest volume areas reached earlier in the day or the high from the previous day like last week).

**Macro**

**Inflation** - Biden needs lower inflation to win.  ‚ÄòMuricans are pissed.  Oil is in everything and people see the price of gas all the time. To quote J Pow - ‚Äúthis shit will be a bumpy road over the next few years on our way to 2%.‚Äù  Only way to decrease the price of oil when demand is hotter around the world than previously thought is to increase domestic output.  Also if Brent gets too high, we might be exporting a bunch more.   Other countries have incentives to keep the price higher (see geo political)

**Economy -** Generally speaking the economies of the world are doing better than thought.  US is growing faster than anticipated (sorry bers). China also seems to be picking up steam after some stimulus, so they can drink up the Russian oil.  This is increasing demand over what was previously forecast.

**Crude -** Most estimates I have seen have been for crude to be high 70s to low 80s for the year based on economic forecasts which are turning out to be low balled.

**Institutional/Retail Ownership -** According to Ortex, the free float is \~65%, but also >50% is held by institutions.  This might lend weight to the divi guys being familiar with/owning PAA and jumping ship from others oil gas divis to PAA for divis and capital growth.

**OPEC+** Opec reaffirmed voluntary cuts into June, this will limit supply from OPEC+ (as much as that can be trusted).

**Geopolitical**

**Saudi budget -**  Fitch ratings estimated the Saudis need >$90 **average for the whole year** to balance their budget. If Q4 is the same as Q1 (\~$75), that would mean an average of \~$105 for Q2 and Q3 for this to hold based on napkin math.  If Q2=Q3=Q4, thats an average price of $95.  I think the first is overly optimistic but is still higher than the $75 PAA used for guidance in Q1.

**Brazil -** lets see what happens here‚Ä¶

**Russia/Ukraine** - Ukraine is trying to take out Russian refineries with new drones.  Can they succeed if it could disrupt US aid in an election year?  Russia also had to put off its new nat gas facility in the arctic due to lack of arctic ships.

**Middle East** - Speculation is that Bibi wants to pick a fight with Iran to bolster his standing in the gov (he might have been ousted had the Hamas situation not happened).  Who knows if this is true, but its a wildcard.

**Election** Biden is a known commodity.  If Trump wins, I think positive perception will flow through to oil/gas domestically (regardless of whether he pumps more).  Other countries might have vested interests in high oil as a proxy economic war against the US (likewise they might not want the US oil to grow too much)

Some sources:

**PAA Business**

**Location of Pipelines**

PAA operates pipelines in the US (e.g. Permian) and Canada.  These locations are important for Macro/Geopolitical reasons, i.e. they are from the ‚Äúgood guys‚Äù (who has ever sanctioned the Leafs who are walking Christmas cards for example). OECD inventories are at multi year lows (and economies are doing much better than anticipated following rate hikes, China seems to be taking off after some stimulus)

**I plan to wait until after summer at the earliest or after the election and will exercise.  I might also hold onto 2026 well into next year if the economy is on a tear - we have 21 months, its not a 0dte.**

Too tired to write more...

Positions:

1000 Aug 2024 calls from $20-$22

1347,4/10 Will be a good day for $TSM,wallstreetbets,T. Rowe Price,320,256,06-04-2024 23:24:20,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bxpfb6/410_will_be_a_good_day_for_tsm/,"**EDIT: added a hindsight report the morning of 4/10. Find it at the bottom of the text wall**

**EDIT: added a graph for those of you who don't know how to read**

Did a little DD on $TSM since they report revenue monthly (4/10) and earnings is coming up and figured I'd share with you lovely apes.

Based on [$TSM's historical revenue data](https://investor.tsmc.com/english/monthly-revenue/2024) along with the little bit of analysis I did (see below), I reckon April will be a beast of a month for $TSM.

Historically, March is the best month every year for TSMC in terms of % improvement from the previous month with 15% improvement on average over the last 18 years worth of data (over the last 4 years only, March is tied with August for the best MoM % improvement). February is the worst in both categories, averaging -12%.

You can see below that I calculated (based on all 18 years of data) the revenue report next week to be hovering around *$209k*, although this is ***most likely*** incorrect due to a couple factors, one being the insane success behind NVDA, who is TSMC's second largest customer just behind Apple (but I wouldn't be surprised if Nvidia takes the #1 spot due to regulations cracking down on Apple), and two being that the MoM % improvement averages are somewhat skewed to the high end due to the rapid growth experienced by TSMC in the late 2010's & early 2020's (specifically March 2018 with a MoM % improvement of 60). To mitigate this, I did did a second set of averages from the last 3 years only. With these averages, I figure that the revenue report will most likely hover somewhere around *$203k*.

I am confident that the revenue report will fall somewhere between or perhaps slightly above the range of $203k-$209k simply due to NVDA.

Should CPI and inflation announcements come out in the market's favor, I see no reason why we couldn't see upwards of a 15% gain on the share price mid next week.

EDIT: currency is New Taiwan Dollars, didn't feel like converting, sns

EDIT: delete my own stupidity, some initial confusion I had about the data but am now sure of

Hindsight Report, added the morning of 4/10 pre-market:

TSMC‚Äôs revenue report came in at 195k, a whopping 34% YoY increase from March of 2023, and a mere 8k short of my low-end prediction; however, the stock spiked very high just before the report was released, then fell off pretty quick shortly after the report was released, I imagine it experienced a little bit of a pump-and-dump over in the Taiwan market. This is most likely due to the report coming out after close in Taiwan. CPI came it at 0.1% over estimate and there was a big overreaction in pretty much every sector. Since this is such a small gap, I don‚Äôt think the dip will last long, and I am still bullish for earnings.

I bought 100 167.5P when the contracts were going for .35, costing a total of 3.5k for the position. These contracts were trading for 7.00 only one hour after I entered, meaning my 3.5k position was worth 70k. This 20 bagger will haunt me.

The strategy was simple and regarded: Tesla had 3 green daily candles in a row leading up to Friday- which if you‚Äôve been following Tesla‚Äôs dog water performance lately- is a huge anomaly so I figured Friday is leaning towards a red day. So I entered the 167.5Puts when Tesla was barely up trading at 169.10 and planned to sell when tesla reached 164ish for an easy 10 bagger from 3.5k to

## Big Tobacco Lost Revenue Due to Disposable Vapes

But it‚Äôs true, analysts have concluded that [**disposable vapes are hurting Altria‚Äôs cigarette sales**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/129123/financial-analyst-disposable-vapes-killing-altrias-cigarette-sales). They reported a loss of 10% of sales by shipping volume and a 2% decline in EBIT.¬†

## Big Tobacco and Big Pharma are Fighting Back by Lobbying Against the Vape Industry

Losing 10% of your revenue is a big deal. So what do you do when you‚Äôre the big sheriff in town? You act like a fucking sheriff and use your guns. Altria [**sued everyone in the vape industry**](https://www.cstoredive.com/news/retailers-expect-boost-njoy-altria-goldman-sachs/689111/) and started [**lobbying to ban vapes**](https://www.bnnbloomberg.ca/altria-is-backing-us-states-moves-to-crack-down-on-illegal-vapes-1.2048274). Shit‚Äôs about to get serious for the vaping industry, like pretty fucking bad.

## PMTA Registered List

Altria bought some lawmakers in [**28 states**](https://www.publichealthlawcenter.org/resources/state-e-cigarette-registry-bill-map) and convinced them to write bills that ban a bunch of vapes. Smoke shops can only sell shit that is PMTA permitted ([**don‚Äôt even get me started on PMTA approvals**](https://vaping360.com/vape-news/128052/fifth-circuit-court-rips-fda-grants-triton-appeal/)). Turns out there's only a handful of products that are approved and surprise! [**They‚Äôre all made by big tobacco**](https://www.fda.gov/tobacco-products/premarket-tobacco-product-applications/premarket-tobacco-product-marketing-granted-orders). Monopoly aint just a game it means we eat more tendies.

So Altria‚Äôs bills passed in at least 3 states already ([**Utah**](https://www.abc4.com/news/politics/gov-cox-signs-bill-banning-flavored-vape-products/), Virginia, [**Kentucky**](https://www.weku.org/the-commonwealth/2024-03-31/vape-product-inventories-at-kentucky-retailers-could-look-different-in-the-years-ahead)), but it was already law in Louisiana, Alabama, Wisconsin & Oklahoma - they just weren't enforcing it‚Ä¶ until [**two weeks ago**](https://www.nola.com/news/louisiana-atc-resumes-vape-ban-enforcement/article_c394fedc-e181-11ee-ac6d-37b83bd90b70.html). **Expect the bill to pass in lots of other states.** 2024 will bring heavy regulation on the vaping industry, which will only help Altria.

## Altria is Creating Their Own Flavored Bluetooth Disposable Vape

So Altria wants to ban flavored vapes? Well, sort of but not really. Altria wants disposable vapes to be illegal, except theirs! Theyre working on a [**bluetooth disposable vape with flavors**](https://www.tobaccojournal.com/news/altria-plans-to-use-bluetooth-for-flavoured-vapes/) and they will bypass the laws AND get it PMTA accepted because it has Bluetooth technology to verify if you‚Äôre underage or not.

Nicotine pouches to [**a little over $5 billion**](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/4-reasons-sell-altria-group-123000564.html).

One of the best parts about this part of the business is that the ex-commissioner of the FDA [**tweeted that nicotine pouches can**](https://twitter.com/ScottGottliebMD/status/1762263657818513615) help smokers quit. At the end of the day, Big Tobacco wins. If you smoke cigarettes, they got that covered. If you wanna vape, they have the only vapes allowed on the market. If you wanna stuff your gourd with nic pouches like a cracked-out squirrel, hit up Altria. Smoking rates may be going down, but nicotine consumption rates are not.

## Altria‚Äôs ‚ÄúMoving Beyond Smoking‚Äù Plan

Altria is dead set on its new campaign, ‚Äú[**Moving Beyond Smoking**](https://www.altria.com/en/moving-beyond-smoking)‚Äù. They know smoking rates are declining so they‚Äôre repositioning to other products like smokeless products, aka On!, and they just bought the #3 vape on the market too, Njoy. That‚Äôs why Morningstar says they‚Äôre worth $49 and Stifel has em at $50 and so many others say it‚Äôs a value stock.

Altria just sold $2 billion worth of AB Inbev (Bud Light) and is flush with cash ready to buyback shares and further increase the share price or inject that sweet sweet capital into their new line of bluetooth vapes. Finally, with [**jobless claims at a 9-week high**](https://www.morningstar.com/news/marketwatch/20240404273/jobless-claims-climb-to-nine-week-high-of-221000-but-theres-little-sign-of-worsening-labor-market), expect even more people to use nicotine as a way to cope with their shitty lives ([**1**](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5896540/), [**2**](https://www.researchgate.net/publication/255976561_Effect_of_economic_crisis_on_smoking_prevalence_and_number_of_smokers_in_the_USA)) while they‚Äôre out looking for jobs and smoking cigarettes, we‚Äôll be eating tendies and banging their wives.

Yet another coronavirus ([animal origin to humans](https://theconversation.com/a-person-in-texas-caught-bird-flu-after-mixing-with-dairy-cattle-should-we-be-worried-227223)) that we know very little about and certainly not enough to stop it.

Current situation:

&#x200B;

[Bird flu in chickens](https://preview.redd.it/y6try66yhhtc1.jpg?width=2059&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=fadc612737765bc87b4d9e474816a898720a4d59)

The first map is meaningless. Everyone is going to hoard chicken, chicken nuggets and eggs but they're wasting their time.

When it comes to chicken, that industry can take a major hit, keep walking and laugh it off. The chicken and egg industry is impervious to issues. They have that shit on lock down.

When it comes to meat that you consume, it's down to ""egg to your plate"" in 28 days. If the birds weren't ""harvested"" at this point, their legs would snap under their own weight. They're fatter than ever but their bone structure hasn't changed to adapt to it.

When it comes to eggs, billions of chickens are laying them daily, at peak, every 16 hours. Eggs last forever, the meat gets wasted because there's so much of it (typically turned to cat/dog food) and because of the genetic changes, they grow faster than ever.

You can wipe out 80% of the poultry population and not even slow it down.

# How do I know this?

3 million miles as a truck driver has taught me plenty about many different industries.

The one that matters here is live chickens.

The highest value and lowest value loads I've hauled were both chickens.

Ever wonder what $8,200,000 worth of chickens look like?

Feast your eyes on this:

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/3titj0f0khtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=6cd7baeb7d3894554dd278b29603db3347e1f2f9

8,200 chickens worth $1,000 each. They had to move a fence to get me to the barn, 2 veterinarians watched the crew load and unload them, I was escorted down the highway, blew through every toll and wasn't allowed to stop. I moved 2 loads between the two barns that week. Final total was $16,500,000 worth of chickens, 4,500 miles and about 14 gallons of coffee/day.

(Humble brag: As long as drivers like me exist, supply will never grind to a halt. We got your back. Fuck a log book! I used 3 and know how to fuck with the new electronic ones. Also never touched a drug in my life.)

These are your purebred chickens that lay the eggs that become your breeder hens that lay your meat hens and egg layers. As long as the purebreds are kept secluded (which they always will be) the poultry industry is fine.

&#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/ijxydf37vhtc1.jpg?width=604&format=pjpg&auto=webp&s=320935df12c355485139c5e06ea560209f11be13

I've also hauled chickens after they've laid eggs for 2 years. 10,000 of them get loaded onto the trailer and regardless of the weather, it was a straight shot until they ended up in Brampton ON and get ground into a paste. From there, they get turned into chicken wieners and sold to Russia. There's not a chance in fuck they'ld ever get sold as food in North America. These load values were $0.01/pd (entire loads were worth about $500).

# There won't be a shortage of chicken, meat or eggs. Don't waste your time trying to find the play.

&#x200B;

Let's discuss beef for a second.

Beef can take a hit and get substituted with pork or chicken for a while and we'll be fine. Also, of all the mafia ridden shit going, beef is definitely it.

There are three loads that border security WILL NOT open in view of the public.

\- feminine hygiene products

\- alcohol (and related adult beverages)

\- frozen meat

&#x200B;

If they did, you can bet your ass that driver is about to get robbed at gunpoint, or killed in their bunk while they sleep for the load.

On the other hand, it's abundant. 

Being Canadian, we have 2 problems up here when it comes to beef;

\- We have way too much of it ([In 2022, Canada produced 3.61 billion pounds of beef and exported 49% of it](https://canadabeef.ca/wp-content/uploads/2023/08/CBEEF-fast-fact-sheet-2023.pdf))

\- [Three meat-packing plants turn out 85% of Canada‚Äôs beef](https://financialpost.com/commodities/agriculture/why-only-three-meat-packing-plants-process-the-vast-majority-of-canadas-beef)

There is a takeaway from the second point. When it comes to recalls due to e. coli in beef, 1/3 of all Canadian beef goes straight into the trash and we hardly flinch.

Final point:

Who is the No 1 beef exporter in world?  
Brazil  
**Brazil** was the biggest exporter of beef in 2023, followed by India, which exports water buffalo, the United States and Australia. Mar 5, 2024

&#x200B;

# This is also not the play.

&#x200B;

Ok, so what is the play?

# MILK

&#x200B;

This shit is more addictive and in shorter supply than crack in the hood.

You can live without eggs and meat for a while but you can't disrupt milk. 

The substitutions are too few and the human meat sack depends on it.

\- school milk programs

\- cheese production

\- butter

\- ice cream

\- yogurt

&#x200B;

You might think that because it's pasteurized that it doesn't matter.

This is where you're wrong.

""In the barn"" means ""in the workers"".

The industries that interact with your milk on a daily basis is almost mind boggling to most. 

Let's visualize that journey:

\- It starts at the feed mill.

\- Then it's a truck driver.

\- The farm hand/farmer at the barn.

\- Another driver who collects the milk.

\- A dock worker.

\- People inside the processing plant packaging the milk.

\- Another truck driver.

\- The person stocking the shelves.

&#x200B;

Whether you realize it or not, that's 50+ people.

Thinking that antibiotics are in milk is ludicrous as well. They're definitely in the cow but not a chance they're in the milk.

If a cow gets sick, they produce way less milk.

The following is a monetary problem. If she's sick for a while, she'll be put down and replaced. If this happens on masse, the farmer is looking at bankruptcy in a matter of months. They make pennies in the end. It's time vs. money.

[The last time this happened, they couldn't total the losses across the industry.](https://www.weforum.org/agenda/2020/04/dairy-milk-pandemic-supply-chains-coronavirus-covid19-pandemic/)

&#x200B;

This should be enough information to get the thought train rolling. The coming milk shortage is the play but I want to make enough out of it to hang up the keys on a 3 million mile career.

&#x200B;

# There's definitely one play here that will outweigh anything else. I want to know what it is.

&#x200B;

Also... why are your weight limits so fucking low in the US?

However, there are signs of a recovery underway as positive news continues to emerge, bolstering investor confidence and attracting attention from financial institutions.

Despite its recent struggles, Embracer Group's stock has garnered interest from banks and investors alike. This newfound support could signal a turning point for the company, as it seeks to regain its footing in the market.

One notable factor contributing to Embracer Group's stock volatility is its high level of short interest in Sweden. Short interest refers to the number of shares that have been sold short by investors betting on a decline in the stock price. In the case of Embracer Group, the high level of short interest could potentially trigger a short squeeze.

As Embracer Group works to capitalize on new opportunities and strengthen its position in the gaming market, investors will be closely watching for developments that could impact its stock price. With the backing of banks and the potential for a short squeeze, Embracer Group's journey to recovery is one that bears close monitoring for both investors and industry observers alike.

In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "

Free Float ‚Äì 44.7M
Market Cap ‚Äì $642M
Technology ‚Äì CAR-T therapy

Targets/Indications ‚Äì Lupus, Myositis, Systemic Sclerosis, mucosal pemphigus Vulgaris, and Myasthenia Gravis (all of them are scary debilitating diseases).

Runway until mid-26‚Äô, and a stated intention to find ‚Äústrategic partnership(s)‚Äù.

Two short-term clinical trial readouts for Lupus (SLE) and Myositis.


The Science:

CAR-T therapies for oncological targets have been all the craze in medicine in the recent past, and in particular, blood cancers.  It‚Äôs not a new treatment, but now it‚Äôs being used to treat indications that are not cancer.  

Cells from the patient are taken in a blood draw.  They are then mixed with a virus that easily infects human cells.  The virus itself does not carry any genetic information of the virus; it carries the genetic information on how to identify and kill a B-cell.  The ‚Äúinfected‚Äù cells that now carry the ‚Äúcorrect‚Äù genetic targeting information are then put into a media where they can grow.  Once they reach an optimal population, they are put back into the patient.  These ‚ÄúCAR-T‚Äù cells then kill off the problematic B-cells in the patient‚Äôs body for a prolonged period of time, and then the patient‚Äôs B-cells repopulate months/years down the road without them engaging in an autoimmune response (attacking/killing the good cells).  

Without sounding like a big salesman for the company (I have no affiliation with the company), there have been striking results published in the New England Journal of Medicine.  It‚Äôs important to note that this Journal has a very high standard of publishing quality data.  They have shown that the ‚Äúconstruct‚Äù (genetic bits that go into the CAR-T cell) will effectively kill off the autoimmune-related B-cells that are hurting the patient, and that there will be a ‚Äúdurable‚Äù effect on the patient (+2 years).  The technology was born out of U-Penn and Oxford and they are partnered with WuXi to scale their initial products.


The stock:

With very little news, the stock peaked around $25 and change.  It has since flittered back down to the low teens and has been bumping around some support lines.  The usual shorting (21% of free float), but nothing too crazy going on.  The analysts SP forecast range is from $25 - $50.  Their corporate slide deck says that they will have their first clinical readouts for both Lupus and Myositis during the first half of this year and we‚Äôre nearly late-April right now.  They will have a second readout during the second half.  Seeing that the stock has a relatively low float for a non-commercialized biotech, any good news would propel the SP, and based on the published data so far, it seems like a probable positive outcome, but yeah, Science is tricky sometimes.

I have a handful of near the money July calls, but I do believe that it would jack up above $20 on good data.  I may buy a few far out of the money calls in July too if the data haven‚Äôt been released in early June.

1358,$RL Ralph Lauren 10 bagger 2.0,wallstreetbets,Target Corporation,128,210,17-04-2024 22:45:05,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6nm1w/rl_ralph_lauren_10_bagger_20/,"I‚Äôm going to provide periodic updates as we move along, as it‚Äôs a longer-term (for WSB anyways) trade. About a month until earnings. 

4/26 Market Close Update

So obviously this has been a fairly painful week for a few reasons, mainly that the stock price has gone up along with the rest of the market. Secondly, the earnings date is set for pre-market 5/23, which means no pre-announcement. No slam-dunk play, and I was obviously early. Because of that, we likely temper return expectations down from 10+ baggers, to probably 5-7x. Still a healthy return.

As part of my update, I‚Äôm going to go through some of the fundamentals that continue to support this play, as well as headwinds, tailwinds, and potential catalysts.

Fundamentals:

The major investment thesis here is that the stock has been HIGHLY overvalued based on too-good numbers from year-end 2023 and partial-month January 2024. I'll continue to dissect why it's still way overvalued, and should return back to pre-February 2024 - and probably even pre-2024 prices.

-Analysts project an upcoming EPS of 1.66. Notably, fiscal quarter Q4 2024 (which is calendar months corresponding to Q1 Jan Feb March) is alway a down quarter for RL and probably apparel due to seasonality.

-Fascinatingly, the current forecast EPS of 1.63 to 1.66 is 81.11% higher than prior-year quarter. Last year's quarter they delivered an EPS of 0.9. Analysts are projecting an almost doubling of EPS. That's fucking aggressive. Although I will say, RL has delivered 80%+ quarterly EPS beats YoY, but many of those have been due to very dynamic situations, including turnarounds from quarterly losses (negative EPS), as well as pandemic shutdowns, pandemic-related inflation, etc. https://finance.yahoo.com/news/ralph-lauren-rl-laps-stock-220018495.html 

-It's increasily hard to imagine a 81% YoY quarterly EPS as projected, especially due to the following: 

(1) in the most recent earnings report from February 8th, they note that they hope cotton prices will stabilize in Spring. If you look at the prices of cotton, they spiked 15-20% following early February and stayed there through the end of the quarter. That's an expense that will hurt projected EPS. 

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday

(2) Holiday season (the last quarter) reported a tax saving of about 10% due to corporate restructuring. Still, YoY the holiday quarter EPS change was 24.48%. This is despite a record holiday season AND the tax savings, which delivered higher profitability of course. Still 25%. Nowhere close to the expected 81% increase for this upcoming quarter. 

(3) I tried to normalize seasonality a bit by taking the previous quarter ACTUALS and dividing it by the expected EPS, and I did it for 2023 vs 2024. In 2023, the holiday quarter actual EPS was 3.35 and the next quarter, which corresponds to our upcoming earnings report, was expected at 0.6. That projection is 17.9% of the previous-quarter actual EPS (0.6 / 3.35). The actual EPS came out to 26.9% of the previous quarter (0.9). For this upcoming quarter, EPS projection is 1.63 (for upcoming report) vs previous quarter actual EPS of 4.17. That's 39.1% of the previous quarter, as a projection. Look at what history has shown. 

(4) effectively, analysts are projecting basically growth-stock YoY increases as a base case, excluding challenges associated with the sector that we've seen since February 2024 (pullback in luxury spending, weakening consumer strength, higher inflation, higher expenses due to higher costs, etc.)

(5) ""For Fiscal 2024, the Company continues to expect revenues to increase approximately low-single digits to last year on a constant currency basis, now centering around 2% compared to 1% to 2% previously. Based on current exchange rates, foreign currency is now expected to have a modest benefit on revenue growth of approximately 10 basis points in Fiscal 2024."" From the last earnings report. How are they going to get 81% YoY quarter EPS improvement with only low single-digit topline revenue increase (IF THERE ARE INCREASES. THEY MAY VERY WELL DECREASE). It's impossible.

(6) On March 4, 2024 - The Lauren Family LLC sold 3 million shares... at $177.15 a pop. That's uhhh, 100% of the LLC's shares as ""long-term strategy for estate planning"". Also, it's about 7-8% of shares outstanding. This ownership entity has not had any other sale transactions in the last 14 years since these shares were acquired. And then sold all of them.

https://investor.ralphlauren.com/node/20766/html

This is a remark in the last report 

Remarks:

Following the sale reported herein, the Lauren Family, L.L.C., is no longer a 10% beneficial owner and this reflects an exit filing by Lauren Family, L.L.C.

Headwinds:

-u/Financial-File-2412 may continue to post ""We are so fucking back"" and it would destroy our positions. On Wednesday in the earlier trading hours we saw the stock start to crater until he commented below, at which exact minute the stock rebounded.

-Surprise beats by other apparel/luxury retailers, which would cause a short-term sympathy spike.

-If April CPI is significantly lower than expectations (unlikely imo), the market would shoot through the moon, interest rate cuts are back on the table, and analyst models would bake in friendlier borrowing costs to juice RL valuation.

Tailwinds:

-Luxury brands continue to crash. u/emergency-sentence41 (see comment below) pointed out Gucci sales dropped 21%, YSL 8%. I also commented with some analysis, see below if you'd like. Macro conditions for RL condition to completely deterioriate, especially since their last earnings call. 

-Inflation has gone up, still, as initially assumed. 

-GDP isn't as high as expectations. This isn't necessarily a great thing, could lead to interest rate cuts. But it could be okay for the play if it's ultra bad and leads to stagflation.

Catalysts:

Unfortunately, not many. A hawkish FOMC meeting. Continued spiking inflation data. A market downturn is of course good for this play.

NOTE ON PRICE ACTION:

Since I posted this DD, the Open Interest has spiked from double digits, to now 1,785. With a trade getting more and more crowded, the counter-party (a Market Maker) usually begins to pay attention. What I mean is, let's say the average price per put contract is 2.50. The MM will have pockted about $450,000 in premiums. However, if the price of RL goes to my price target of $120, they're in the hole for $13 million. Citadel Securities is a market maker. Citadel Advisers is their hedge fund arm. They are not in the business of losing positions, and they will actively try to front-run the trade. Therefore, you'll see a lot of weird spikes and price action on RL, especially on low-volume, non-catalyst days such as the previous week. You'll see dramatic and scary spikes, then sell-offs, then end-of-day or beginning-of-day spikes. They want to keep the price high and price action bullish to shake you weak handed maggots.

Stay strong, the fundamentals are gonna crush this stock. We just have to wait now for the existing longs to catch on. As I mentioned, volume is incredibly low right now. RL is already a low-volume stock, so quite easy to manipulate, but RL shareholders (both retail and institutions) have ZERO reason to sell at the moment. They're still look at rosy fucking guidance and clear blue sky EPS projections (almost DOUBLE last quarter? LOL). When reality hits that the expectation was laughably high AND future guidance drops due to softening market conditions... that's when you'll see the volume come. And the volume will be insanely bearish.


That's it for now ---

4/19 Market Close Update
-So unfortunately the Middle East conflict didn‚Äôt do a ton to move RL downward. It appears the Israeli counter-attack was more de-escalation than anything. Gotta stay tuned to see if Iran does some crazy shit, but I think both sides know that it is not in their best interest to have an open war. They prefer the shadow channels.

We see this because oil and the indexes initially spiked on Thursday night, but quickly recovered as the market digested the meaning between the strike. 

We also saw a divergence between SPY and QQQ throughout the day. I think this red day is moreso due to the SMCI news (lack of pre-announcement) and the semis following along, pulling down tech. 

This of course, is a non-catalyst to dump consumer discretionary, thus many CD stocks were unhit (including RL).

-Generally speaking, RL tends to trade neutral-to-slight red. Don‚Äôt be too alarmed on $1-$2 pops, as it usually sells off towards the end of the day. Please also note, on non-news days, it‚Äôs pretty low volume. Today included. 

-Speaking of SMCI‚Äôs lack of pre-announcement (which is what the semis reacted to), stay tuned next Weds or Thurs (probably Thurs), as that‚Äôs when RL will announce their official earnings date. I entered this trade at this time because there‚Äôs a non-zero chance there *COULD* be a preannouncement guiding downwards. If so, THAT‚ÄôS the major catalyst we‚Äôre aiming for. Could see a drop of 10-20% that day, with a slow grind down going into May as analysts revise their price targets. 

-Speaking of analysts, keep in mind that this low-volume, existing ~$160 price is mostly because institutions and their analysts (along with analysts who cover the stock) have inked in the previous guidance and earnings that were projected from the last earnings call. I describe in my below DD why I think it‚Äôs wrong. But of course, market doesn‚Äôt dump until real data comes out and the projection models get updated. It‚Äôs the analysts‚Äô job to plug in assumptions and project. NOT their job to verify and continually update the inputs as market conditions change. RL stock and analyst targets are still based on hot air. 

Other catalysts to look towards could be:
-god forbid, further war escalation 
-a REALLY hawkish FOMC meeting at end of April. They likely just announce no rate cuts soon but the market has already priced that in. They MAY indicate a rate hike is necessary IF pce data comes in hot, AND if they signal April data reaccelerates inflation. It‚Äôs a non-zero chance. 
-Other apparel giving bad guidance or news. RL will sympathy trade with other apparel. 

4/19 That‚Äôs it for now.

Original Post:

I'm here to announce that I've closed my Ralph Lauren position that I had posted DD on (linked below).

[https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph\_lauren\_rl\_is\_a\_10\_bagger/](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1blbrn6/ralph_lauren_rl_is_a_10_bagger/)

I had purchased in total \~$15,000 in OTM puts, they were June 2024 with a strike price of $150.

When I had opened my original $150Ps, my thesis was that macro headwinds (inflation, CPI, consumer discretionary spending is slowing, etc.) would allow for great timing for those longer-dated puts, **in addition to** holding the puts through the anticipated \~5/23 earnings call. That thesis was exactly right, and I hit the mark about a week early, but I took the ticker from \~$188 to \~$159.

All-in, I sold it for about a 400% gain.

And then I immediately doubled down and bought further OTM puts (June 2024, 140Ps) with 100% of my newfound capital.

My DD for my double-down is for the following reasons:

# 1. CPI/inflationary data has come in hot

Wage growth still high, GDP still high, disinflation has stopped, and has even reaccelerated to the upside. Gas prices continue to climb and will continue to climb as the middle-east situation shakes out - especially as we start entering the summer months. Thus, higher rates for longer. We've seen the US 10T spike 40 bps since I posted my original DD.

# 2. Consumer debt has exploded

Holiday season hrough Q1, people were still maxing out credit cards to spend on core and non-core items. Now we're starting to see people wake up to the reality that they need to be more mindful of their budget, especially as interest rates will likely remain at this elevated level.

# 3. Consumer discretionary spending has completely stalled

You might think ""but wait, consumer spending report on Monday was good!"" - not so fast; while the March 2024 report (released April 15th) shows 0.7% retail sales MoM and 4.02% YoY... the real story within the report (pertinent to this investment thesis anyways) is that NAICS code 448 - Clothing & clothing accessory stories is down -1.6% MoM (from Feb 24 to March 24)

It's indicative of a consumer base that has exhausted their consumer discretionary budget, and therefore can't afford to splurge on luxury/clothing like they did during the holiday season and early 2024.

This is consistent with **Nordstrom's** latest earnings/guidance;

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/05/nordstrom-jwn-earnings-q4-2023.html)

**Macy's**

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/02/27/macys-m-q4-2023-earnings-.html)

Plus retailers (and especially clothiers) are getting punched in the mouth.

# 4. PVH Corp, owners of Tommy Hilfger, Calvin Klein, is down after poor guidance (TL;DR on this point is weakening Europe and NA wholesale demand)

This is a direct competitor to RL, and the biggest reason for their decline is **weakening demand in Europe** (I'm going to circle back to the bolded point later).

[https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/](https://www.reuters.com/business/retail-consumer/tommy-hilfiger-owner-pvh-shares-plummet-after-downbeat-annual-forecast-2024-04-02/)

Also included within the article is this statement

 *""Retailers such as PVH, Levi Strauss*¬†[*(LEVI.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/LEVI.N)¬†*and Ralph Lauren*¬†[*(RL.N), opens new tab*](https://www.reuters.com/markets/companies/RL.N)¬†*have struggled with weaker wholesale business in North America due to department stores and retailers cutting back on orders owing to slow consumer demand.PVH's wholesale revenue declined 10% in the fourth quarter, as wholesale customers across North America and Europe continued to take a cautious approach.""*

Which is in line with my thesis that clothing/discretionary retail is getting killed. Notable here is that **wholesale business** is down (will also circle back).

It's down 24% since their earnings release (April 2nd).

# 5. LULU showed North America sales slowing.

[https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html](https://www.cnbc.com/2024/03/21/lululemon-lulu-earnings-q4-2023.html)

# 6. I believe China sales will also slow dramatically. 

Despite the creative data coming out that the Chinese economy is still strong, the middle class is definitely getting pinched. Young adult unemployment is really high (despite whatever is being reported), anecdotally I work at a Chinese financial company and they all their relatives are complaining that the economy is ice cold still.

# 7. RL's latest quarterly financials are going to get rocked

https://preview.redd.it/ejn1zaud94vc1.png?width=704&format=png&auto=webp&s=f7d2bc6dd52fa339fc51867956c437afe1f9e9b8

As you can see, RL north american sales are already slowing 2022 through year end 2023. There's a reliance on European and Asian top-line growth. However, PVH disclosed weakening guidance in Europe. I strongly suspect weakening guidance in China. NA sales is already weakening, and will continue to weaken.

[https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday](https://investor.ralphlauren.com/news-releases/news-release-details/ralph-lauren-reports-strong-third-quarter-fiscal-2024-holiday)

Further, about 45-50% of topline sales is generated through RL wholesaling. That's slowing as well.

8. Current $RL price ($159) is still hugely overvalued and will certainly fall off a cliff

The stock pumped on their February 7th, 2024 earnings report (and stellar guidance). They had a phenomenal quarter, with holiday sales crushing.

**Unfortunately**, the guidance was given based off of year-end 2023 data and **maybe** partial January 2024 data. 

The guidance was flawed because it did not incorporate any consumer discretionary softening that other retailers have since disclosed (PVH, LULU, etc.). In fact, $LULU actually revised their guidance UPWARDS on January 8th, 2024 [https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference](https://www.businesswire.com/news/home/20240108049404/en/lululemon-athletica-inc.-Updates-Revenue-and-Earnings-Expectations-for-the-Fourth-Quarter-Ahead-of-the-ICR-Conference) off the back of a strong holiday season. The immediately following earnings call, the stock has fallen 28%.

RL is in the same position. Gave great guidance on February 7th, 2024 due to a stellar holiday season. The stock EXPLODED higher from $147 to an ATH of \~$192. 

The current price is a pullback from macro headwinds, but has not yet fully priced in the fact that the previous guidance was based on hot air.

Finally, There is a gap to be filled from $162.5 to \~$140, stemming from the previous earnings pump.

I suspect that any amount of headwinds (Israeli response, and therefore full blown war), continued poor inflation data, etc. will chip away at the stock price well before earnings, to fill the gap down. There's just very little liquidity at these levels, and a sell off with send RL down to $140.

Within the week (I estimate April 24th or 25th, Ralph Lauren will announce its May 2024 earnings date.).

There's also non-zero chance that RL will also issue a pre-announcement revising earnings and guidance in advance of the earnings call. If my thesis is right, the huge upcoming disappointment in earnings may have to be pre-annoounced.

TL;DR

RL will gap down, get puts. 

PRICE TARGET $120 by end of May.

1359,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Target Corporation,39,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"

Just an update on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bollba/tsla_42069_by_end_of_the_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I am still doing uber during the night. Used the proceeds brought 2 more calls. 

If there is a chance, I will let the riders know about Tesla cars, and let them experience FSD V12. 

Just some thoughts I wanna share:

* there are quite a number of people who realized that under current interest rate, it doesn't make sense for them to own a car, their transportation cost per month would be lower than the monthly payment for a car + related costs. They don't need to worry about parking, theft, traffic etc. (prospect future rideshare app customers)
* there are a lot of people who are still on the fence about buying an EV. (prospect customers for cars)
* Majority of the Male riders are much open on using FSD, female riders are exactly opposite of this. (tsla marketing team should take note on this)
* Robotaxi would probably go through stages
   * the first stage would be something I am doing right now, there will be a driver supervising
   * 2nd stage would be when tesla announce they take liability while car is driving on FSD
   * 3rd stage would be majority of the cars on the road is driving on FSD, the higher the percentage, the safer and more efficient the robotaxi will be, the growth and profit margin will be exponential

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "
1383,IS ANYONE ACTUALLY BULLISH ABOUT $CCL?,wallstreetbets,Travelers Companies (The),9,39,24-04-2024 20:49:32,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cc982d/is_anyone_actually_bullish_about_ccl/,"Is anyone bullish about $CCL??? Honestly, take a look at the fundamentals, the bottom and top lines, and consider its potential for growth.

(Travel demand surging + CCL undervalued = üöÄ potential.

Loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of 100+ ships.

Long-term play, potential 5x-10x return.)

I'm bullish about $CCL, and here's why:

First, let's take a look at the fundamentals. Carnival Corporation & plc ($CCL) is the world's largest cruise company, with a market cap of approximately $18.79 billion as of April 24, 2024. The company has a solid balance sheet, with a debt-to-equity ratio of 0.78, indicating that it has a manageable amount of debt compared to its equity. Additionally, $CCL has a loyal customer base and a fleet of over 100 ships, making it a major player in the cruise industry.

Now, let's consider the company's financial performance. In 2023, $CCL reported revenue of $24.5 billion, a significant increase from the $5.6 billion it reported in 2022. This indicates that the travel demand is surging, and $CCL is well-positioned to benefit from this trend.

Moreover, $CCL's stock price is currently undervalued, with a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 10.4, compared to the industry average of 15. This presents a great opportunity for investors to buy the stock at a discount and benefit from its potential growth.

The company's history also supports a bullish outlook. Before the pandemic, $CCL was a high-flying stock, with a P/E ratio of over 20. While the pandemic had a significant impact on the company's financial performance, it has since recovered and is now back on track for growth.

Essentially, with a loyal customer base, solid balance sheet, and a fleet of over 100 ships, $CCL is a long-term play with the potential for a 5x-10x return. The surge in travel demand and the company's undervalued stock price make it an attractive investment opportunity."

-   Grab app also offers a wallet feature that allows users to make  payments online and in person, send money to family and friends, finance  purchases over time, and even buy travel insurance.

Tuesday:  GE is expected to kill it with a 159% increase in earnings. It‚Äôll be interesting with forward guidance considering the big trouble at Boeing.  RTX is expected to be flat with earnings, but with the recent $95B military aid package passed, I would think amazing guidance.  TSLA - big day with expected earnings to be down 41%.  Elon needs to pull a rabbit out of the hat!

Wednesday: Durable Goods Orders  0.3% expected with the last report of 0.5%.  BA earnings are expected to further diminish by an additional negative 12.5%. Wonder if they plan to name the new CEO?  Big Daddy Meta to report with estimated earnings almost doubling to $4.36.  High bar!

Thursday:  GDP estimated 2.4% versus 3.4% yoy.  CAT estimates are earnings up 4%. I would think the Infrastructure Bill to kick in by now.  Microsoft earnings expected to be up 13.7 % - low bar they need to double back flip over it.  Then GOOG expected earnings up 22%.  The band on TikToc will be interesting on the price action for Google & Meta this week.  Big AMZN expected earnings down 17% low bar - I like Amazon. 
 
Friday:  The Fed‚Äôs favorite PCE yoy estimated 0.3% -  flat compared to prior 0.3%.  Core PCE less food & energy 0.3% - again flat versus prior of 0.3.

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

And increasing  
FORD'S RECURRING SUBSCRIPTION REVENUE IS MASSIVELY GROWING:  
Ford has big goals for software sales to small business truck fleets

Plus it looks like Tesla's FSD and no Anxiety and Quick Fill up for Ford might merge. Rumors about Ford in talks to license FSD would make Ford fleet business unstoppable. A driver that never gets tired installed in every Ford Fleet vehicle to supplement the tired groggy driver, or even replace him or her. 

Ford is fleet king:

Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.
* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say ""wow, my savings are losing value""; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to. Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up. When you lose 25% of your purchasing power and live paycheck to paycheck, you are forced to adjust your lifestyle or take on incremental debt. 
   * Off the last bullet, [credit card debt is at an all time high](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-debt-record-high/), and [credit card delinquency is worst on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/credit-card-delinquency-rates-were-worst-on-record-in-fed-study?embedded-checkout=true).

The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-22986/child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf-program) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income; however, that figure is roughly 24%. [Bank of America said the average childcare payment per household has risen over 30% since 2019 for its customers](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.html). We are at a point where some families are determining if they are better off to become a single income household versus a dual income household with child care.
* While the USD still remains the most dominant force (by a significant margin), regardless of opinion on sanctions, sanctions typically lead to weakening the USD. Further, nations are considering moving away from the USD more now than ever before.

* [GDP missed estimates this morning at 1.6% versus estimates of 2.2%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/us-gdp-first-quarter-report).
* Finally, not to mention all of the chaos going on in the world right now. Conflict in Eastern Europe, conflict in the Middle East, the US border crisis, China & Taiwan, etc.

All the while, we are being told that everything is fine! There is nothing to worry about! This is the soft landing we have been looking for, and inflation is normalizing...right?

Let me be honest with you up front, the chances of either of us executing and getting correct every directional play are extremely low. I‚Äôm currently down 95k this year and have dreams of making my money back. 


I have allocated 25k to my Robinhood account for this challenge. Yes, i see the irony that gambling on earnings plays have gotten me into a deep hole. Yoloing on earnings got me in, and Yoloing can potentially get me out! If you want to follow my journey this next week save this post. 

Let‚Äôs be honest with ourselves here, there is only one way to make a lot of money in one week and that is to gamble. No strangles or straddles, just calls or puts and hold overnight and pray. We sell the next morning at open and prepare to yolo again if we don‚Äôt blow up. 

The most important thing when attempting an earnings marathon is having your plan and sticking to it. If you don‚Äôt execute your plan, you will get to the end of the week and wonder ‚Äúwhy‚Äù you didn‚Äôt buy those contracts and hold them after close.   This doesn‚Äôt mean you‚Äôre correct in your play. It just means you have the balls to see it through. I was planning on doing this earnings marathon this past week and looking at the simplest method to achieve the goal I believe i would have pulled it off if i would have committed. The problem was I got scared and didn‚Äôt pull the trigger. 

I have made peace with the fact that I‚Äôm going to lose this money in an attempt to recover substantial losses. You can comment here to give me ideas and DD for plays that you believe will work, i will consider them. 

Earnings Marathon

Week 1:
Tesla - Calls
Meta - Puts
Google- Calls

Week 2:
MSTR: Puts
SMCI & AMD: Puts
Carvana: Calls
Apple: Calls

Week 3:
Monday after close / Tuesday before open
Palantir, Disney: 

Tuesday after close / Wednesday before open
Arista, Lyft, Uber, Shopify, Affirm, Toyota: 

Wednesday after close / Thursday before open
Arm, AirB&B, Robinhood, Beyond Meat, Duolingo:

Thursday after close / Friday before open
Mara, Soundhound:

These are the companies reporting this week and i need to decide on Calls / Puts for the closest expiration date.

My Idea so far is to start with Palantir & Disney and play Calls on both splitting the port 50/50.

Just an update on my previous [post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bollba/tsla_42069_by_end_of_the_year/?utm_source=share&utm_medium=web2x&context=3).

I am still doing uber during the night. Used the proceeds brought 2 more calls. 

If there is a chance, I will let the riders know about Tesla cars, and let them experience FSD V12. 

Just some thoughts I wanna share:

* there are quite a number of people who realized that under current interest rate, it doesn't make sense for them to own a car, their transportation cost per month would be lower than the monthly payment for a car + related costs. They don't need to worry about parking, theft, traffic etc. (prospect future rideshare app customers)
* there are a lot of people who are still on the fence about buying an EV. (prospect customers for cars)
* Majority of the Male riders are much open on using FSD, female riders are exactly opposite of this. (tsla marketing team should take note on this)
* Robotaxi would probably go through stages
   * the first stage would be something I am doing right now, there will be a driver supervising
   * 2nd stage would be when tesla announce they take liability while car is driving on FSD
   * 3rd stage would be majority of the cars on the road is driving on FSD, the higher the percentage, the safer and more efficient the robotaxi will be, the growth and profit margin will be exponential

I‚Äôm a peon salve laborer Uber driver making two fiddy an hour and this is not financial advice. Lately I‚Äôve come across new found wealth when Uber and Lyft paid out their quarterly healthcare stipend totaling $1,500 and I‚Äôve found myself at an old and not unfamiliar fork in the road. Should I buy $1,500 worth of 0 dte options and blow up my account for the 20th time or‚Ä¶‚Ä¶..

Buy ""options"" that NEVER expire at a futuristic space company pushing the boundaries of the last great frontier. 

**The math:**

**The DD:** 

Virgin Galactic NOW has close to a billion dollars in cash, that‚Äôs twice its market cap and way way more than 99% of the scamy spacs that are now on their way to 0 and that bears love to compare it to.

So why is it so cheap?

The burn rate is 400 mil a year..

Path to profitability: 

Back in Nov 2023 VG has laid off 185 and halted all flights for 2024 in order to focus its resources on building out the new Delta spaceship fleet. The new craft has a turn around time of a few hours enabling it to make daily flights.

Each craft will cost around 50 mil and the initial fleet will consist of 5 crafts, 4 operational and 1 backup. They plan to put this craft to work running between 300 - 400 flights per year and generating an annual revenue of around $1.3 billion with a gross profit of $800 - $900 mil.

New Delta spaceship factory in Phoenix close to completion, production on the Delta craft set to begin in the coming months.

**In conclusion:**

SPCE, while absolute overvalued garbage back in 2021, is now way undervalued and overlooked for its potential. It will vary likely need to raise more cash to reach profitability but sentiment will eventually pick back up and I'm here for it."

2 years ago when NVDA was under $300 I said they really have no peer in this space. I said it will probably triple in a 2 years even at it's inflated price.

https://np.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/qw9glx/im_surprised_there_isnt_more_nvda_talk_before/

I was playing golf at my club and guys who were 60+ on the tee box were talking nvda and smci and everything they said was wrong.  Then I walked into the restaurant to eat and again I heard the boomer pro talking about it. Funny thing was I remember him dogging on it when it was sub 200 having too high a PE

I had a plan and my limit order sold at 900 awhile back but when my mom asked about NVDA I just had that sinking feeling like she asked my about my decentralized currency when it hit ath but my limit order had not filled .  I remember her asking about my currency around nov 2021 at thanksgiving which was literally the top, and again at thxgiving or christmas years prior in 2013 and 2017 she again called the top.

Bless her but my mom and boomers have a way of warning about the top.

EDIT: I just think it‚Äôs way harder for a company like NVDA which owns 99% of datacenter GPU to keep that 99% and I already seeing AMD, QCOM, ARM, AMZN, MSFT, GOOG, Meta making their own and making in roads and chipping 1% here and there.  

Much like any IT person who worked in datacenters and colocations pre 2016 saw INTC own 99% of datacenter.  It was easy to see it‚Äôs very hard to keep 99% and when you lose a few % the ‚Äústreet‚Äù or ‚Äúmarket‚Äù pivots quickly.  

5+ years ago I said AMD at $1.80 I said INTC would start shedding that 99% dominance.  

https://np.reddit.com/r/AMD_Stock/comments/9v1n6f/amazon_web_services_aws_pricing_amd_vs_intel/e994dka/

When you own 99% of the market imo once the pivot happens, it‚Äôs almost like a landslide in stock price. And it moves in cycles, companies will buy a bunch of NVDA GPUs and they might add a little bit the next year or the year after but you won‚Äôt have large purchases.  No one is buying 1 billion dollars of GPUs every year or quarter.  This business cycles and when it goes down it‚Äôll go down for 2 years and rocket up after when people need to bulk order."

https://preview.redd.it/ygiyo0h18psc1.png?width=722&format=png&auto=webp&s=cd5bb92852115b714901840476c4d6051198d58c

Let's dig into the numbers and see how they got such a massive increase.

https://preview.redd.it/amb9cpk28psc1.png?width=1003&format=png&auto=webp&s=16b1385156e6dabb81cf05ebc73139833581ea51

Here we can see that they are showing $1 billion from unrealized gains on debt and equity securities. The year prior that number was $752 million. So they are counting unrealized marked to market gains on their stock holdings as if they are net income from the business. Interesting. Let's examine further.

From the 10-Q:

***Income from operations was $652 million, up $794 million YoY and $258 million quarter-over-quarter (‚ÄúQoQ‚Äù).***

Soooo, if my math is correct, they made $652 million from operations and $1 billion from unrealized capital gains, so essentially two thirds of their reported profit was from unrealized gains. So what are those holdings that made them so much paper money?

Later from the 10-Q:

***During the three months ended December 31, 2023, unrealized gain (loss) on debt and equity securities, net primarily represents changes in the fair value of our equity securities including: a $659 million unrealized gain on our Aurora investment, a $414 million unrealized gain on our Didi investment, partially offset by a $91 million unrealized loss on our Grab investment.***

So they have three major holdings:

* Aurora Innovations
* Didi
* Grab

They say they ""earned"" $659 million from their Aurora investment, $414 million from Didi, and lost $91 million from Grab.

So how much of these companies does Uber own? If we go by this headline from last summer, we can figure its about 326 million shares of Aurora:

https://preview.redd.it/1dmrlmf48psc1.png?width=1184&format=png&auto=webp&s=b0a6dfab21333c95ebc572991e204ffe8e85b0c8

So if they made $659 million in three months, the stock must have appreciated about $2.

Let's looks at the charts from Q3 (10/1/23-12/31/23):

https://preview.redd.it/ps61s2w68psc1.png?width=785&format=png&auto=webp&s=f5ad0fdbcb379c8e192f5b03c8a7fc8b94843237

https://preview.redd.it/9l4whws58psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=b607d395efc1477eb3441812649d57757cecbff3

https://preview.redd.it/77ylgjb88psc1.png?width=784&format=png&auto=webp&s=5a2e9e94c5da7e9ff440ec5a8b386c11059a63eb

This one looks interesting. On September 29th, AUR closed at $2.35. On December 29th (the last trading day of 2023), it closed at $4.37. Wait- that's $2.02! Exactly the amount they reported times their holdings of 326 million shares!

Similarly, on September 29th, DIDIY closed at $3.23 and on December 29th, it closed at $3.95, for a nice $0.72 gain. Given that they reported a $414 million gain in the same period on that investment, they must own about 575 million shares.

Finally, GRAB closed on September 29th at $3.54, and December 29th at $3.37, for a loss of $0.17. Given that they claim a loss of $91 million in that period, they must own about 535 million shares.

Okay, so to summarize, Uber reported $1 billion of profit off three unrealized gains:

* Aurora Innovations ($659 million gain)
* Didi ($414 million gain)
* Grab ($91 million loss)

It seems a bit sketchy to me that 2/3 of profit was reported on unrealized gains in a very speculative portfolio, but whatever, the market seems fine with it.

But that begs the question, wasn't the bulk of their profit due to the happenstance price movements of two stocks in a three month period? What happens if they are flat or (gasp!) down in the next three months?

Well, let's see how those three investments fared in the last quarter, now that it is in the books:

https://preview.redd.it/4qn9q9eb8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=7966a528e737ed7ecde768468971b64ec97e987a

First up, as previously stated, GRAB closed on 12/29/23 at $3.37. And on 3/28/24 (the last trading day of the quarter) it closed at $3.14, showing a loss of $0.23. Given Uber's holdings of 535 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $123 million.

https://preview.redd.it/o0y52wtd8psc1.png?width=786&format=png&auto=webp&s=e8dab9c4010d06df0edb55f86ba7dacdbdaf4874

Next up DIDIY. As stated, it closed on 12/29/23 at $3.95, and on 3/28/24 it closed at $3.83, showing a loss of $0.12. Given Uber's holdings of 575 million shares, this would equate to a loss of $69 million. Nice.

Now for the punchline. Let's check last quarter's big winner, Aurora.

https://preview.redd.it/tsc6is8f8psc1.png?width=787&format=png&auto=webp&s=a95c6c9b0af60f894ce5819ad3f3e79546f0ccf4

Wow, that don't looks so good. As stated, on 12/29/23 AUR closed at $4.37 and on it closed at $2.82, for a loss of $1.55. Given Uber's holdings of 326 million shares, that represents a loss of $505 million!

So let's tally up the damage here:

* Grab: $123 million loss
* Didi: $69 million loss
* Aurora: $505 million loss

So in total, Uber lost $697 million in the last quarter on the very same investments that made them $1 billion in the prior quarter. The market, she giveth and she taketh away.

Meanwhile, analysts are estimating $0.21 per share, which equates to $420 million. Given the $697 million shortfall we already know about that's a near certainty and very easy to verify, that means that Uber would have to earn a profit of $1.1 billion from operations alone just to meet expectations! That would be roughly double the profit that they made last quarter. It turns out the unrealized gains pendulum swings both ways.

TL;DR- Uber reports unrealized gains (and losses) as part of their profit every quarter. Last quarter was a major anomaly during the year end chase for two of their holdings, Didi and Aurora. Aurora promptly collapsed right after the quarter began, largely reversing a major profit driver from last quarter. Short this stock for easy money.

As an aside, this begs the question what other companies report paper gains as real profits and benefited from last quarter's massive run?

**Positions:** I'm short 100 shares as of now and holding 18 July 19th $70 strike puts and 15 May 17th $65 strike puts.

Likely adding in the coming days and used today's vertical movement to add said puts.

**Edit:** For all the regards here screaming PRICED IN- the stock went up $4 yesterday because a random analyst at Jeffries said ‚Äúit will go to $100 because they‚Äôre offering a lot of options in the app.‚Äù There is no rationale behind these movements. It‚Äôs been going up purely on momentum. You think these analysts are following their portfolio? I read one who thought they were invested in Aurora cannabis. They spend ten minutes writing these notes and then discuss where they want to go for lunch."
1406,ELF: An Inflation-Fatigued Gal‚Äôs Best Friend,wallstreetbets,Ulta Beauty,80,55,05-05-2024 03:30:44,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cki4bo/elf_an_inflationfatigued_gals_best_friend/,"Gather round, friends. We‚Äôre cooking up some serious tendies today.

And give this WSB lurker some grace on his first ever DD. I was waiting for somebody else who knows what they‚Äôre doing to do this DD justice, but I‚Äôve been quietly profiting off the best of y‚Äôall‚Äôs work, and I‚Äôd like to return the favor. If I‚Äôve done anything wrong, please let me know so I can update it, as I really do want to do this well. But if you can‚Äôt look past any formatting errors I may have, that‚Äôs on you. Feel free to hop over to yet another DJT write-up where a bag-holder from the initial spike will try to convince you it‚Äôs going to $100 by EOW.

So here‚Äôs the dealio‚Ä¶ about a month ago, ULTA CEO David Kimbell told some folks at J.P. Morgan that ULTA had experienced a slowdown in demand during Q1. ULTA promptly dropped from $520 to $440 in a day and has kept sliding down to just shy of $400 as of this writing. Practically every stock in the beauty industry fell along with it. While lots of them are now drastically oversold given that all ULTA really did was predict they‚Äôd be on the lower end of their existing 4-5% growth guidance, I believe ULTA‚Äôs warning is actually amazing news for one Wall Street darling that took a pretty serious beating for no good reason and is now likely the cheapest it will ever be again.

Enter ELF. If you haven‚Äôt heard of ELF, I really don‚Äôt know what to tell you. They‚Äôve been gobbling up market share like crazy by making ‚Äúdupes‚Äù of crazy expensive beauty products and selling them for $12 instead of $70. AND THEY‚ÄôRE REALLY FREAKING GOOD AT IT! As soon as some crazy overpriced product starts to take off, ELF cranks out their own version that most consumers actually like better than the original, and sells it for a fraction of the price‚Ä¶ all while being 100% vegan, cruelty-free, and ‚Äúguilt-free,‚Äù something the younger generations have been eating up. But enough lip service (pun intended). Here‚Äôs why a broke Master‚Äôs student like myself has bet almost his entire portfolio on this one stock:

1. 85% sales growth last quarter plus a huge guidance boost. While other beauty stocks have cut their full-year forecasts already in 2024, ELF has kept on raising theirs. For those who love consistency, last quarter was their 20th consecutive quarter of growth.

2. Piper Sandler‚Äôs Taking Stock With Teens survey revealed that ELF is the #1 top cosmetics brand among teens in 2024, with 38% of teens selecting ELF as their favorite brand, up from 22% in 2023. The next top brand is only preferred by 9% of teens. Talk about taking market share and building a loyal customer base.

3. My fianc√©e knows practically nothing about stocks, but I‚Äôve been trying to include her in my investing strategy since my money will be hers in a little over a year. A few weeks ago, I started asking her which companies that she knows lots about were due for a big crash or a big upswing. She told me to short LULU. She didn‚Äôt understand why I couldn‚Äôt stop laughing until I pulled up the chart‚Ä¶ it had tanked exactly six days earlier. I‚Äôm still kicking myself for not asking her the week before. Anywho, a few days later, she told me about ELF. I told her ULTA had just reported a slowdown in demand due to inflationary pressures. She asked if I was really going to listen to some CEO instead of her. I reminded her that we have a wedding to pay for. She told me if I listened to her, ELF would pay for our whole wedding and more. We went back and forth for a while, but here‚Äôs when she won me over‚Äîagain, she knows almost nothing about stocks or markets or consumer spending habits, so this really had me speechless: ‚ÄúPeople aren‚Äôt responding to inflation by buying less beauty products; they‚Äôre responding to inflation by switching to cheaper ones. What if the so-called ‚Äòslowdown‚Äô is really just people switching from luxury beauty products to cheaper value products instead?‚Äù Quite a thesis, huh? And here‚Äôs the kicker. ULTA‚Äôs last quarterly report backs it up. ULTA‚Äôs total comparable sales increased 5.7% in 2023. That year, transactions increased 7.4%, but the average ticket decreased 1.5%. Translation ‚Äì‚Äì> ULTA is hurting because they‚Äôre selling MORE STUFF at LOWER PRICES ‚Äì‚Äì> If only there was an oversold company we could invest in that specializes in selling more stuff at lower prices ‚Äì‚Äì> ¬†My fianc√©e is a genius and way out of my league ‚Äì‚Äì> Calls on ELF!

4. ELF fell with other beauty stocks after ULTA released a vague warning about slowing demand. In fact, ELF now sits a 28% below the all-time high it set in March. But if it‚Äôs true that the slowdown is mostly affecting companies like ULTA and their luxury brand suppliers (as indicated by their slashed guidance) and could actually be helping ELF (which raised guidance with their last quarterly report in February, presumably due to killer January sales), then ULTA‚Äôs warning could have both made ELF cheaper while also giving the SEC filing sleuths (that‚Äôs us) good reason to think ELF just quietly ended a knockout quarter which they will report earnings for on May 22.

5. My fianc√©e tells me the fastest growing segment of the beauty industry is skincare products. I haven‚Äôt fact checked her on this, but ever since she predicted a LULU crash that she had no way of knowing had already happened six days prior, I don‚Äôt question her anymore. ELF bought a skincare company called Naturium at a super fair price last October, and I expect that acquisition to only further boost their sales and outlook this next earnings release.

6. Let me save the bears some time in the comments. Yes, it‚Äôs PE is higher than other beauty stocks. But with 85% sales growth and 38% of all teenagers saying it‚Äôs their favorite brand (up 16% from last year), I think you‚Äôll agree it‚Äôs warranted.

7. I know some troll in the comments is going to just copy and paste ‚Äúbuy high, sell low‚Äù in about as many ways as they know how, but ELF is actually well below its March high, and it just broke out of the head and shoulders pattern in time for a nice little run-up until (and up through) earnings.

TLDR: ULTA released a scary warning last month saying the beauty industry is in trouble, sending beauty stocks into a free fall. What they forgot to mention is that the beauty industry is only in trouble because ELF has been selling better products for lower prices than any other player could even dream of. ELF is oversold and will absolutely demolish earnings (and probably even raise guidance AGAIN) on May 22.

Positions: $165 call for 5/24 and a $145 leap call for January 2026. Don‚Äôt judge me for being poor and having only two calls‚Ä¶ if you have the money, I strongly encourage you to load up on way more than I can afford to.

Ulta Beauty (ULTA) finally pulled back to my $440 entry point today.  I am all in with 50 Jan 25 options at $480 strike (bought as ULTA hit my trigger).

NOTE: Given the big run up today, I cashed out today as ULTA hit 460.  If it pulls back down, I will be buying again, but it was prudent to take my profit today. Looking at the chart - the stock has done this a few times, where it will have a dead cat bounce, then more selling pressure, and ultimately recovery.  

While the market puked on the CEO's early soft guidance preview, I think this 15% haircut is an overreaction. A 5% slip? Sure. But a full-blown 15% beatdown? That's an opportunity.

A few reasons I'm backing up the truck on ULTA here:

üí∞ Best-in-class loyalty program driving stickier customer base and superior data

üíÑ Unique positioning as the only major player straddling prestige and mass beauty in an accessible way

üíØ Exceptionally well-run company that consistently executes year after year

While it may take until next earnings for ULTA to fully recover from this guidance-driven gut punch, I'm very confident the long-term fundamental story remains intact. The selloff has created a gift in one of retail's highest-quality franchises.

The panel is lit up to buy ULTA aggressively under $450. Elite loyalty ecosystem, smart multi-channel strategy, and flawless execution - what's not to like?? I know analysts are sharpening their pencils, expect possible buy recommendations and a snap back."
1409,"Intel : the opportunity of this decade for retails and the ""Duck You Wall Street"" really deserves",wallstreetbets,United Airlines Holdings,441,356,29-04-2024 05:59:33,https://i.redd.it/g884d41bzcxc1.jpeg,"OK regards listen up!
This is my first and only planned post here since I joined this group at january 2021 at the Yolo of that particular stock who cannot be mentioned since it get modded away to see what WSB is all about.

Not surprisingly, I saw bunch of complete regards having day dreams of how to get rich fast with buying calls or puts, both are losing strategy in the long term since you can't compete against cartel of big banks and big hedge funds that are making the opposite bet.

That's fine, that's amusing sometimes to see the losses, but if you want the real wins and give a real ""Duck You"" to wall street and actually gain wealth in the process:  

Persistent investing always been the key against them at the stock market, aka DCA aka keep buying the ducking dip on those turnaround companies that Wall Street hates and tell you to get away from.

Wall Street needs you to buy those stocks at higher price few years from now when they finally upgrade them, they cannot afford you buy low and sell high, they make money when you buy high and sell low.

I have been investing since 2011 and I encountered more then once Wall Street scam behavior.

At 2012 bought Facebook after the ipo when Wall Street said its going to die and stay away.

At 2014 bought Microsoft when the new ceo that we all know today shift the focus to Azure cloud unit and Wall Street kept say its dead company.

At 2017 bought AMD when Wall Street were scaring us about bankrupt scenario.

Too many times Wall Street tried to scam their way that you won't hold the biggest opportunities in the stock market until they say so, let's end this now!

Now let us talk about the opportunity of this decade : Intel.

Intel might be the most hated stock of Wall Street nowdays, from analysts of the big banks, Jim Cramer on TV, kids at YouTube and Tiktok investing ""guides"". Literally everyone bushing this company.

There are solid reasons for this bashing of course, but there are also huge positive signs for the future that almost everyone ignores or hide from you.

Intel is currently on multi years transition phase, it has officially split their manufacturing units (fabs) aka ""Intel Foundry"" and their chip design units aka ""Intel Products"".

When you look at the numbers, you find that Intel Products are very profitable, able to cross the big downside of losing market share over the years and finally stabilize.

Intel Foundry on the other hand is the losing part of Intel now, big losing part,  billions each quarter, this are the headlines you see on the news that scares you like Intel going bankrupt.

All those headlines, all the fear spread, what those scam analysts not mentioning that the big lose is due to the huge investing Intel is doing right now by building the next generation of fabs.

""Intel lost billions"" is not intel lost billions, it is in fact ""Intel investing billions to make huge money after that"".

How much money you ask? 

I believe Intel Foundry will have more then 50bil yoy revenue by 2030, which combine with Intel products can lead to 100bil+ revenue a year (double the revenue from now).

Intel transition to seperate design (Intel products) and manufacturing (Intel foundry), is much needed not only for Intel, but for the entire western world and it is backed up by the US and Europe and their entire arsenal of defense contractors. 

As the allmighty Warren Buffet like to say :""never bet against America"".

I'm not even talking about their other growth segments of mobileye and Altera, which they also expected to boost the bottom line in the future.

Most importantly, Intel so close to achieve what the ceo planned 3 years ago in 5 nodes 4 years plan, which those analysts and media said 3 years ago it couldn't be done. Intel are so ducking close to achieve that, that those analysts realized they screwed up, but they can't tell you that yet, they just wait for the price to stay low so they can upgrade the stock price later on and look like a winner picking.

This is what Wall Street has always been doing.
Now let's add few more amazing facts about this stock:

Trading close to their book value as low risk factor.

P/S less then 3 as cheap valuation.

Massive Forward P/E expansion after capex of the new fabs will finish as value adding factor.

This is the holy trio for finding those life changing wealth investments at the stock market.

So how you can hurt this scammers of Wall Street that tells you to stay away from Intel and try prevent you taking advantage of this beautiful setup of wealth gain in the upcoming years, how you say? 

By buying the stock now!

Don't wait till they tell you it is time to buy, which probably the upgrades will start to come at late 2024 - mid 2025. Keep adding now each month, be consistent. This is the way to punch them and ruin their plans.

So what is the bottom line here you say? 

Forward P/E between 6-8 in 2030! 

On neutral scenario of 6 and solid multiple of 20, you will get fair value stock price of 120! 

That is even before the extra growth after 2030, which I think we all understand that the chip industry will keep leading this world for the next age.

120 fair valuation at 2030, that is my target. That is how much cheap this stock is right now since it trade at the lower 30.

Here are my long term positions: 

NO CALLS , buying and holding the stock.
Hodling 38,208 Intel stocks at this moment of typing and keep counting, as I will keep buy each month after I get my paycheck.

Average price here of 32.2 

That is a major position for me, that currently account for more then 70% of my portfolio. Why? Because this is the most amazing opportunity I see for this decade.

Your welcome, God speed, and buy the deep ducking value."

In the ever-evolving landscape of technology and innovation, few companies stand out as prominently as NVIDIA. With a track record of groundbreaking advancements in graphics processing units (GPUs) and artificial intelligence (AI), NVIDIA is positioned to not only maintain its current success but also experience significant growth in its stock price. Here's why investors should pay close attention to NVIDIA's trajectory:

Dominance in Key Markets: NVIDIA's GPUs are the cornerstone of its success, dominating the gaming market with their superior performance and efficiency. Furthermore, NVIDIA's GPUs are increasingly essential in data centers, powering AI applications, cloud computing, and scientific research. As these markets continue to expand, NVIDIA's revenue streams diversify and strengthen, providing a solid foundation for stock price growth.
AI and Machine Learning Revolution: The proliferation of AI and machine learning technologies is driving demand for NVIDIA's GPUs like never before. As industries across the board integrate AI into their operations, NVIDIA stands as the go-to provider for high-performance computing solutions. With its GPUs at the forefront of AI innovation, NVIDIA is well-positioned to capitalize on this transformative trend, translating into sustained revenue growth and ultimately, stock price appreciation.
Innovative Product Portfolio: NVIDIA's commitment to innovation is evident in its diverse product portfolio, which extends beyond GPUs to include products like the NVIDIA A100 Tensor Core GPU, designed specifically for AI workloads. Additionally, NVIDIA's acquisition of ARM Holdings positions the company to expand its reach into the mobile and IoT markets, further fueling its growth potential.
Partnerships and Collaborations: NVIDIA's strategic partnerships with leading technology companies and research institutions amplify its reach and influence in the industry. Collaborations with giants like Microsoft, Amazon, and Google solidify NVIDIA's position as an indispensable player in the tech ecosystem, fostering continued growth and market dominance.
Financial Performance: NVIDIA's strong financial performance underscores its potential for stock price appreciation. With consistent revenue growth, healthy profit margins, and a robust balance sheet, NVIDIA demonstrates its resilience and ability to thrive even in challenging economic conditions.
Visionary Leadership: Under the leadership of CEO Jensen Huang, NVIDIA has consistently demonstrated a forward-thinking approach and a willingness to invest in long-term growth initiatives. Huang's vision for the future of computing aligns perfectly with emerging trends, ensuring that NVIDIA remains at the forefront of technological innovation.
In conclusion, NVIDIA's stock price is poised for growth due to its dominance in key markets, leadership in AI and machine learning, innovative product portfolio, strategic partnerships, strong financial performance, and visionary leadership. For investors seeking exposure to the rapidly expanding tech sector, NVIDIA represents a compelling opportunity for long-term growth and value creation. As the company continues to push the boundaries of what's possible in computing, its stock price is likely to reflect the immense potential that lies ahead."

1413,"Is Tesla preparing a capital raise? Production cuts, massive layoffs... and the Robotaxi narrative",wallstreetbets,United Airlines Holdings,217,178,17-04-2024 09:30:40,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c65j7b/is_tesla_preparing_a_capital_raise_production/,"Hello everyone,

I do follow Tesla a lot and I was not surprised by the mass layoffs announced the other day. The company is in a dramatic situation for its traditional car business, although the cash position looks strong, these factors make me think that the company might be preparing a capital raise:

&#x200B;

* FCF is now negative, as in Q1-2024 the company produced 433k cars and delivered 387k. 46k new cars in inventories is a big cash burn, unprecedented for the company. You can monitor Tesla inventories here [Tesla Inventory website](https://tesla-info.com/blog/inventory-stats-regional/Global?q=4) As you can see from this chart, inventories stayed high for most of Q1 despite ever-present inventory discounts (in the USA)
* Companies that need to save cash, often cut production, fire white-collar employees, and try to maximize their income. Tesla did all of these three things, as it also cancelled all its inventory discounts in the USA (as they will satisfy demand by trying to sell the inventories). If you plan to raise capital, the new investors might want to feel reassured that you are not going to burn it through crazy discounts or overproduction capacity (yes, Tesla has a big overproduction problem)
* even if they might not build any new giga factory, despite their steady news flow on the topic last year, the company needs a lot of cash to build its Robotaxi data center brain. As everybody knows, $NVDA GPUs are super expensive
* Elon switched the narrative completely: new profile pic, not the ugly X one, car sales do not matter, only FSD & Robotaxi do, the company survival now is only about AI applied to transport
* the investment bank that has been more vocal in defending Musk & Tesla is the one that used to have the highest target price in the street. Morgan Stanley's Adam Jonas famously published a report in September 2023 saying that Tesla deserved a $400 price target for its AI efforts. The report was badly received (except for the spike it triggered) as MS was implying that Tesla was a better Nvidia than Nvidia ( see this article from the Financial Times [""Adam Jonas explains why Tesla will be better at being Nvidia than Nvidia""](https://www.ft.com/content/d7f139d3-aebb-4932-8c0e-034c92bce963) . Well, as you will see below, many AI executives in charge of the Tesla supercomputer resigned, and other AI executives left for OpenAi or Musk's own company xAi. Moreover, MS is very silent in the last week, even if they used to update investors daily. Probably a capital raise is coming after earnings next week.
* Still, it is weird that Tesla issued debt of $4 billion last year, despite its huge cash position. The only company that did that is Parmalat in Italy, that is the biggest bankruptcy scandal in Europe after Wirecard

&#x200B;

**Business is failing in China, FCF bleed has to end to raise capital**

In this post I evidenced the huge amount of new models that is arriving on the Chinese market. Xiaomi, BYD, and Huwaei partners are presenting models that will eat the cake of Tesla in the incoming months [Tesla's China competion thread](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778360917677289886) And that's why Tesla postponed (cancelled) M2 development as China already offers today cheap cars [M2 postponed (cancelled) acccording to Reuters & Electrek](https://electrek.co/2024/04/15/tesla-puts-electric-car-codenamed-nv9-back-burner-despite-elon-musk-said/)

In Q1 Tesla probably sold its bitcoin holdings, which will provide some relief. if they sold at peaks, this would provide $700 million in cash. Although severance pays from layoffs and the Giga Berlin terrorist attack might hurt by similar amounts.

**No need for new factories if you fire 15-20k workers** 

Well, everybody knew that Tesla had an overcapacity problem (this why they reduced production in Shanghai in March 2024  [Giga Shanghai cuts output](https://fortune.com/asia/2024/03/22/tesla-cut-ev-production-china-plant-amid-sluggish-sales-growth-intense-competition-worlds-biggest-car-market/) Still the company loved to let medias speculate about new incoming factories worldwide. In 12 months I counted 12-13 countries announcements in different countries just to keep the giga growth dream alive  [Giga factories speculation worldwide](https://twitter.com/EdwardDiGi/status/1778066496075223507)

Still, Tesla needs to invest a lot in R&D and datacenters as they are behind most of big tech companies

Musk clearly said that they will invest a lot in new GPU from Nvidia. We do not know what happened to DoJo, but several of its executives (including the head) left [Tesla DoJo head left Tesla](https://www.reuters.com/technology/teslas-dojo-supercomputer-head-leaves-former-apple-exec-lead-bloomberg-news-2023-12-07/)

**New narrative: cars do not matter anymore, Elon is in warmode, but will the robotaxi save everyone ?** 

These are the estimated sales from the street for the next years, in terms of unit cars:

* 2024 1'950'000
* 2025 2'280'000
* 2026 2'750'000
* 2027 3'340'000
* 2028 4'150'000

As you can see, huge growth will happen in 2026, but if the cheap model is postponed (cancelled) as China and many other OEMs already offer cheap BEV today, how Tesla can compensate these missed revenues? 

 First of all, Tesla has not yet applied for a robotaxi license [Robotaxi license](https://www.nbcnews.com/tech/innovation/robotaxi-regulators-say-tesla-hasnt-contacted-plans-rcna147456) while Waymo already operates in the USA and China already has several Robotaxi operators. Tesla is not a pioneer, is actually late

Secondly, how many robotaxi drives can compensate for these huge miss of sales from M2 model lineup? analysts counted that billions of profits and revenues will come from that? whats next?

Thirdly, lets assume that Tesla and others succeed with the first robotaxi. Then what if owning a car does not make any sense and transport becomes  a commodity? Robotaxi will cannibalise MY & M3 sales. 

Fourth, given the complexity of the topic, I expect robotaxi to be operated by public companies, not private ones. 

In conclusion, not only in the last 5 quarters WS has been always wrong in estimating Tesla car sales, but it seems they got the entire business & financial model wrong !

**Tesla issuing debt while being net cash positive, plus interest income does not much with the declared net cash balance**

Despite its huge net cash balance, Tesla issued debt several times last year:

* [$1 billion ABS July 2023](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2023-07-14/tesla-hits-abs-market-in-first-debt-sale-since-blue-chip-upgrade)
* [$1.8 billion ABS September 2023](https://asreport.americanbanker.com/news/tesla-prepares-to-issue-1-2-billion-in-electric-vehicle-secured-notes)
* [$0.75 billion December 2023](https://www.moomoo.com/news/flash/17186908/tesla-issued-auto-loan-backed-bonds-for-the-first-time?level=1&data_ticket=1713345722100374)

This is very weird, and it should be considered a red flag as the young CFO abruptly left in August 2023, being replaced by the Chief of Accounting.

According to some estimates, also the Net Interest income of the company does not match with the declared cash holdings. The delta became smaller over time, but still noticeable

https://preview.redd.it/9z1ituyxc0vc1.png?width=1845&format=png&auto=webp&s=fe470e52ad20ddf73e494d432817132514fb70a2

Probably Tesla boosted its cash balance in the past selling most of the cars at the end of the quarter, collecting the VAT and making it to appear as cash in the balance sheet. Now that the sales waves are smoothed in the quarter, probably they cannot do this any more.

**CONCLUSIONS**

I would expect Musk trying to boast as much as possible the robotaxi potential during the ER. Although the cancellation of M2, negative FCF and losses likely through the end of 2024 would make it a hard pill to digest. Regardless, this should be the last chance to raise capital at these expensive valuations. $10-15 billion of raise would be a reasonable amount.

Morgan Stanley expects $1.12 EPS in 2024 from Tesla, which is a 160x PE forward...that is crazy if compared to the 30-35x of NVDA. The street is still at $2.5 EPS forward but many have not yet updated their models (still 70x PE forward is expensive according to any metric)

Earnings season has just kicked off, and the companies are already hitting the court, ready to show us whether they've shit the bed or not. Let's gear up for a strong start. IT'S GAME TIME BABY!!!!

Today, I've got two companies that I'll be gambling on: **UAL (United Airlines)** and **ASML (no one knows wtf ASML stands for)**. Let's get right into it:

&#x200B;

1. **UAL** \- Look, when I invest in a company, I don't give a fuck about their business as long as they're making money and not heading for bankruptcy. But when the CEO starts pushing their political agenda into their company, that‚Äôs when I start getting a little concerned, and by a little concerned, I mean very concerned. A few months back, the CEO announced a goal for 50% of new hires to be women or people of color. I‚Äôm not a racist or misogynist, but why push DEI into the cockpits? Call me a right wing extremist all you want, but I want the cockpit crew to be chosen for their flying skills, not because of their zigzagzirzemza pronouncs. Scott Kirby don‚Äôt give a shit about his passengers, only about avoiding labels like racist or transphobic. He‚Äôd rather crash 3452 planes than face such accusations, just hire the old white dudes....... This will all backfire, planes will be crashing out of the sky, and he will be testifying in front of Congress. This ain't looking good‚Ä¶‚Ä¶.. I‚Äôll be shorting this tonight.
2. **ASML** \- Everyone knows ASML makes chip-making equipment, and they're from the Netherlands. Nothing good comes out of the Netherlands regarding business, except Shell and ASML. Now that Shell has moved to London in 2022, ASML is also looking to relocate, which has politicians in The Hague stressing. A month ago, they started operation ‚ÄòBeethoven,‚Äô which is basically this: We‚Äôll give you $2.7B in tax breaks, infrastructure investments, build a whole ASML town for your employees, and many, many more things, plzzzz don‚Äôt leaveüò≠üôè. You have to realize: the Dutch elections last year gave ASML a lot of leverage. The party that won the elections (PVV), wants to close all borders, but 40% of ASML‚Äôs employees are foreign. They really want to leave, and are just playing hard to get now, and I predict the government will pump this company to the moon, just to get them to stay in Holland. This will 99.999% reflect in their future guidance. Expect green dildos tomorrow morning.

In January 2021, **we updated our investment policy** to provide us with more flexibility to further diversify and maximize returns on our cash that is not required to maintain adequate operating liquidity, allowing us to invest a portion of such cash in certain alternative reserve assets including digital assets, ***gold bullion, gold exchange-traded funds*** and other assets as specified in the future.

Goldman raised the PT on gold to $2700

China is buying up gold at a record pace. My thought is once they reach their reserve target they may make some sort of announcement that may send a earthquake through the markets. 

&#x200B;

The point is it makes sense to hold a bit of Gold and silver, as a insurance policy. you pay for car insurance, home insurance, health insurance, you need some portfolio insurance. We may see a trend of other companies updating their investment policy if treasuries continue to sell off and our nation debt interest payment get out of control.

1417,Delta Airlines ($DAL) ER DD,wallstreetbets,United Airlines Holdings,42,74,08-04-2024 21:40:22,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzabys/delta_airlines_dal_er_dd/,"Hi Regards,

I will not be answering messages, but will comment here and there as my time allows. I have more DD, but I do not have the energy to post an essay. Remember, this is not financial advice, but a quick, high level DD, for the majority of people who play options based on emotion or trends, or to hedge their plays (as options were initially intended for).

I may scalp some or I may not. I may post if I do, I may not. If you can afford to hold, hold your options play post earnings. Remember, the day of **EARNINGS** is when the CPI, Inflation Rate, FOMC Minutes are announced.

My position: $48.5C

The other guy u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) posted that DAL will 'shit the bed' based on a variety of incorrect data.

  
Here is why I believe Delta Airlines ($DAL) will go up a modest \~8% to 12% post earnings:

1. On their previous earnings, they expected a capacity increase between 3% to 5%

2. Full year 2024 EPS expected to be $6 to $7 a share

3. Most of Delta's aircrafts are NOT the Boeing 737 Max. Yes, they have ordered them, but the deliveries are delayed.

4. Those who fly Delta, are aware that this is a top airline. They are a part of the Sky Alliance Team, and most of their airline partnerships charge far more than their competitors (on average).

5. As u/[GarthbrooksXV](https://www.reddit.com/user/GarthbrooksXV/) mentioned a 'Bonus Reason.' Here is mine:

Bonus Reason: During AMEX's previous earnings call, the CFO responded to questions with the following responses regarding Delta Airlines ($DAL):

***""So, I don't -- you know, we'll see whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's a data point. But we keep seeing, you know, a lot of strength and, you know, the partnership we have with Delta is working very, very well. Originations, you know, of new cards are very strong. And, you know, cardmembers decided to redeem a bit less in Q4 with airline tickets than they did in the past.""***

***""Yeah. So, the Delta product is still going very, very strong. The total billing growth on the Delta product for the full year was up 15%, and we originating a lot of new cards as well. My comment about their, you know, softness in terms of Q4, hard to say whether it's the beginning of a trend or whether it's just a blip.***

***Time will tell. But it's still going very, very strong. And the engagement with the partner -- you know, with the partner is very strong. The partnership is going strong.***

***So, I don't see any softness there at all. And, you know, I will say as well that their credit quality of those new cardmembers remain very strong. I made comments about it's one of the fastest-growing segment on the loan side. and it comes with very strong performance.***

***People who travel a lot and who fly a lot tend to have strong credit quality, and we see that on the loan side, on the spend side, on the origination side. So, you know, I'm not worried about that at this stage.""***

This is nothing against the other user, I am just stating my DD since in my opinion, I believe his had a lot of incorrect information.

This is NOT financial advice.

Best Regards,

Baymax

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

On Monday, I had 120k in $UNH. No options though just equities. 

 So far this year, it has worked fairly well as I have made about 25-30k which is half my salary in capital gains.

In much the same way most of us settle for streamed movies vs Bluray due to cost and conveinience, I can totally see gaming going in this direction sooner than we think. 

The ability to instantly load up any game without installation and run it on a max spec machine is amazing.  The quality and framerate is noticably worse still but nonetheless suprisingly fine for a casual session.  

How long do you feel before most people no longer choose to own consoles or high end PCs and just subscribe to gaming services?  What do you think will happen to companies like Playstation and Nintendo who sell so many hardware units?    And what about companies Nvidias GPUs moving from mass consumer owned to almost exclusively data centre owned?

Honestly even today, as a casual gamer, I would 100% choose to just subscribe to XCloud than drop $2K on a GPU. I think this paradigm shift in the consumer owned hardware market is going to happen pretty fast. "
1422,$AMZN Earnings Tuesday,wallstreetbets,United Parcel Service,76,80,29-04-2024 01:22:37,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1cfmrhe/amzn_earnings_tuesday/,"I think Amazon will have a pretty decent pop after earnings on Tuesday, for a few reasons:

# Continuing to Cut Costs

Amazon has seen many rounds of layoffs in the post-Covid era, and those have continued in Q1 and Q2 this year. Most recently they have nixed their just walk out technology for Fresh stores and the associated teams in AWS. Investment in unproven or unprofitable technology which ran rampant with Bezos is being eliminated under Jassy, contrast this with Meta continuing to light money on fire for the metaverse vision, and how their earnings went. The result is a leaner more profitable machine in the short term, though long term innovation could suffer.

# AI Strategy

Amazon may say they're in the race for Generative AI, but we all know they can't compare to OpenAI's models. They don't need to though. Their focus has been on creating a marketplace where most models are owned by third parties such as Anthropic, Meta, Mistral and open source models. AWS provides the infrastructure and customers pay a premium for it, knowing their data will stay in the AWS network along with their other existing cloud infrastructure. This makes a big difference for Fortune 500 and other large customers focused on security. Apart from pay-per-token, which all AI SaaS companies offer, AWS Bedrock also  offers purchasing blocks of capacity called Model Units for 1 or 6 month commitments to guarantee certain levels of token throughput. They will see a big boost in sales for these and it will boost outlook for next 2 quarters. They are struggling to keep up with demand for underlying GPU infra, which will be a good thing for the numbers. Lastly, on Tuesday Amazon will announce GA for it's next gen home-grown model Titan Text Premium. While I still don't think it will compete with OpenAI or even Anthropic's offerings, it will provide more choice and cost optimization for customers, and will be seen as a good thing at least by the C-Suites of the large companies choosing AWS Bedrock over OpenAI. And that's all that matters.

# Prime Day

Prime Day 2024 has been announced for July. Each of the past prime days have always seen new record high sales and beat internal estimates, so Q3 outlook will be juicy.

# NBA Rights

Amazon Prime has reached an agreement with the NBA to air games starting with the 2025-6 season. The contract will likely last for 10 years. Coupled with the success of their TNF deal and price hikes plus ads addition to Prime Video, the streaming service outlook will be strong.

# Investors Over Employees

Andy the Jasshole and his S-Team aka the Jass Band have really made corporate employees unhappy with how the return to office mandate has been handled, denying annual pay raises this year across the board for all L6+ employees, and layoffs. A lot of talent is leaving voluntarily, senior engineering positions are being backfilled with junior level positions, and the company has pitched this as a good thing. Andy is being a good boy and doing exactly what the board and his major shareholders want, Bezos' long term thinking and customer focus can go to hell. Certainly cuts cost in the short term, but I think this is analogous to overmilking a cow. At some point, they will run out of manipulations and see diminishing returns. While I'm bearish on Amazon in the long term as I think the tech will start to crumble and competitors will be poised to take market share, it's all good news for Q2 costs and outlook. Like the my other points, this just means lower cost structure and stronger guidance for 2024-5. Google is using the same playbook and they did just fine on earnings. It will be some time before both of their reckonings come, and by then Andy and Sundar will have safely landed their golden parachutes.

# Summary / tl;dr

I'm a highly regarded individual and don't have numbers to back my thoughts up, but I know Amazon well. Earnings will show big profits and strong outlook. ~~I don't have any position yet but will update tomorrow, just planned this over the weekend. Hoping the stock falls a bit Monday, but regardless planning to buy some ITM 5/3 calls with a breakeven price around $183-185.~~

Long charging times and range anxiety has Hertz dumping their EV's like a bad time and temperature abused hamburger puke explusion :

how many gas stations in the U.S.? : 196,643¬†, source: https://www.xmap.ai/blog/gas-stations-in-united-states-of-america-everything-you-need-to-know#:\~:text=xMap's%20essential%20geospatial%20insight%20into,States%20of%20America%20(USA).

How many ice vehicles? : 265 Million, source: https://www.instituteforenergyresearch.org/fossil-fuels/gas-and-oil/new-registrations-of-gasoline-vehicles-are-still-growing-despite-the-ev-push/#:\~:text=But%20those%20numbers%20barely%20dent%20the%20288.5,were%20at%209.9%20million%20(3.4%20percent%20share).

That ratio is 265 million vehicles to 196,643 gas stations. That's a mighty huge chasm in numbers, but it works solely because people can fuel in less than 5 minutes and be on their way and zero range anxiety. No massive waiting lines form.

Compare to EV's: 3.3 Million in the U.S. How many chargers and outlets available in the U.S.? How many EV 'fueling stations?' : 62,610 EV stations AND 168,330 EV charging outlets. A total of : 230,940 EV 'fueling Stations'. That is 34,297 MORE EV fueling stations than ICE traditional Gas Stations, at 196,643. 

And that is STILL NOT ENOUGH. Why? it's the TIME it takes to charge them. The waiting in line for over half an hour on each charge to just charge half way is what is causing this problem. So more EV chargers are needed to deal with the TIME is takes to charge and RANGE anxiety. EV's are NOT ready for prime time. And the only solution is HYBRID. 

I have a personal story to this: My local bank has FOUR EV chargers on their lot. Not Tesla chargers, the lesser cooler ones, and seemingly less reliable ones. STILL EVERYTIME I go to my local bank, there is a 1970's oil shortage line of frustrated ornery EV car owners, but there is no shortage of OIL this time, it's the shortage of EV stations, despite numbering over 200,000 outlets to fuel from( more than gas ice gas stations), there are not enough to help lower the wait time it takes to charge up,  some outside their cars with their doors open, WAITING, all pissy and ornery on being able to EV fuel their vehicle. 

Next time you see a fleet of Amazon Delivery vans, COUNT how many are Ford vans. ; ) Then look to see how many Tesla's , Rivian, or BYD or whatever EV brand you can think of of Amazon fleet vans you'll find. 

Hertz renters frowny faced Tesla's because of their: 

1. Long Fill up Time, 30 minutes to only fill up halfway.

2. Range Anxiety. 

None of which are issues with Hybrid,  or ICE. 

Ford's last ER was stellar: 

Ford Pro was =40% increase in Hybrid Sales. Ford Pro = 18 BILLION, up 36% yoy Ford Pro Vehicles Sold= 409,000, up 21% yoy Software subscriptions for services increasing. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

 Ford Pro achieved first-quarter revenue of $18.0 billion, up 36%, together with EBIT of $3.0 billion. The segment‚Äôs EBIT margin of nearly 17% exceeded the sustained mid-teens margin target set for the business. The results reflected higher production of Super Duty trucks ‚Äì the 2024 North American Truck of the Year and the most dependable large heavy-duty pickup after three years of ownership, according to J.D. Power ‚Äì and Transit vans. With guidance from Ford Pro, more customers are progressively choosing to electrify their vehicle fleets, including the United States Postal Service (9,250 E-Transit vans through the end of 2024) and Ecolab, the global sustainability company (more than 1,000 F-150 Lightning pickups and Mustang Mach-E SUVs). Over the past 12 months through the first quarter, about 13% of Ford Pro‚Äôs EBIT came from software and physical services, including parts and accessories ‚Äì on the way to a goal of at least 20% within a few years. Software subscriptions with commercial customers grew 43% year-on-year to more than 560,000 by quarter-end.

Revenue from Ford Pro commercial customers jumps 36%, EBIT more than doubles, with high demand for Super Duty work trucks, Transit vans and software/physical services ‚Ä¢ Ford Blue‚Äôs strong global product lineup includes new versions of F-150 and Ranger trucks; hybrid volumes on pace for 40% full-year growth

Plus it looks like Tesla's FSD and no Anxiety and Quick Fill up for Ford might merge. Rumors about Ford in talks to license FSD would make Ford fleet business unstoppable.

* Total card spending per household rose 0.3% year-over-year (YoY) in March, following the leap-year boosted 2.9% YoY increase in February, according to Bank of America aggregated credit debit card data. The early Easter holiday likely brought some spending from April into March. Controlling for these seasonal impacts, spending fell 0.7% month-over-month (MoM).

- Commercial: this will remain under pressure for at least another 90 days.  I suspect we will see a pressure release as the summer goes on, but despite low expectations, things can actually get worse.  I don't believe we will see an uptick in number of planes they are getting out and I also believe their unit costs are increasing not reducing

- Defense: this will see some improvement. Not enough to offset still terrible fixed cost contracts.  It will take the rest of the year to work through. I believe BA is losing out on some lucrative contracts due to all the distractions and noise 

- Services: it's fine, but can't bail two big deadweights

A correction is very healthy for a Bull market.  The earnings season will surprise to the upside - very strong.  I believe the market will continue to roll up for the following reasons:

1) The recent hot jobs market is due to an increase in leisure/entertainment and medical workers.  These areas were most affected by the pandemic.  Yes a lot of government jobs added as well - it‚Äôs an election year for the current Uncle Sam.  I believe the current workers above is fully staffed.  Service jobs will flatten and wages will normalize.  

2) AI is just starting and will drive a whole new cycle in computing hardware from phones to data centers.  The electrical grid will require a rebuild.  A battle for electricity is underway between eV‚Äôs and data centers.  Data centers will win as will those companies involved with power generation and infrastructure.   

3) The Fed - get over them.  Interest rates in the United States averaged 5.42 percent from 1971 until 2024.  I don‚Äôt see them hiking & maybe throwing in a token cut.  

4)  The shift to global isolation leaves no alternative but to invest in the USA.  Importing disinflation is over, but we have the resources and the digital revolution will drive productivity.  Let Russia and China buy up the gold.  I rather buy the best companies in the world.   

5) We went thru two Bear markets in the past   4 years - many shitty companies were weeded out.   The market is healthy.       

We are still early in a long cycle Bull market. Average in - buy the dips on SPY.  Small cap‚Äôs are bargain basement- buy the Russell. If you have  some favorite stocks buy them & call leaps.  My opinion only.

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

&#x200B;

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

March sales numbers in Taiwan are out. As a reminder Taiwan covers 95% of Gogoro's revenue currently. This year Gogoro exceptionally launched new scooters in January (Pulse) and February (JEGO) so the comparison is not straight forward to last year. Considering actual orders instead of deliveries Gogoro has established +27% growth in Q1.

YTD 2024 sales 7,321 scooters (last year 10,593).

https://preview.redd.it/tb4pa3g0lmsc1.png?width=496&format=png&auto=webp&s=10c7c722c6b1922a0bb8dcfacb1bb60b1031814b

However, a big bunch of scooters have been ordered but not yet delivered (not in stats):

\- Pulse pre-orders: 1,400 (25 units in March numbers, 90% most expensive model)  
\- JEGO pre-orders: 5,300 (577 mostly trial vehicles in March stats).

***Actual orders in Q1: 13,419 (+27% compared to last year).***

A quick analysis of sales: Gogoro exceeded Q1 orders compared to last year, a positive development. However, reported Q1 numbers might appear lower due to deliveries scheduled for Q2. Nonetheless, expectations are for strong Q2 figures. Hopefully, Taiwan sales maintain their growth trajectory throughout 2024, with anticipated positive news from international markets.

**Product Launch Analysis - JEGO and Pulse**

I've been hoping for Gogoro to replicate what Apple did with the iPhone SE‚Äîan affordable option with great specs that appeals to cost-conscious consumers, while still maintaining premium flagship products. This parallels the Pulse vs. JEGO product positioning.

It's noteworthy that JEGO garnered 5,300 orders in a month, especially when considering the broader 2023 sales per model. This indicates significant potential, provided sales continue on their current trajectory and Viva orders remain stable.

Pulse has received 1,400 orders already and there is a lot of hype in the air as it's clearly the best EV in the market in its class. Reviews have been good and what comes to sales it will be interesting to follow how SuperSport sales figures will be impacted in the future.

**Governmental Support for EVs is Part of Sustainability Megatrend**

\- Taiwan: current EV adoption is 9% and the goal is to reach 35% by 2030. Gogoro has plenty of potential in Taiwan and government continues provide considerable subsidies.  
\- India: government has raised EV charging ecosystem support in one of their main goal in the near future.  
\- South Korea: subsidies to EVs available.  
\- The Philippines: Executive Order 12 defines that EV vehicles tariff fee is 0% instead of 30%. Two-wheelers are not included but there is a EO 12 yearly review ongoing to remove the tax from two-wheelers as well. Basically all relevant parties support the amendment and it is likely to happen in the coming months. In practise it would mean that Gogoro scooter resale prices would drop about 30% in the country and boost EV adoption.

**Gogoro's Key Metrics and Good to Know:**

\- Best battery swapping product/services in the market.  
\- Company has $173.9 million cash balance and they are controlling costs efficiently.  
\- Gogoro has invested $650-$700 million to Taiwan's battery swapping network.  
\- Sticky and growing subscriber base generating significant amount revenue. Number of subscribers at the end of Q4/2023 was 587,000, so pre-orders included the subscriber is now close to 600,000.  
\- 95% of revenue from Taiwan currently. Goal is to increase international revenue to 10% this year (main focus in India).

**Battery Swapping Network**

\- Over 1,3 million batteries in circulation.  
\- Taiwan: 13501 racks in 2584 locations.  
\- South Korea: estimated 600 racks in 200 locations.  
\- India: getting started in Delhi. 75 racks in 25 locations. Goal is to have 100+ locations by the mid 2024. India long-term potential at least 20x compared to Taiwan (Gogoro's estimate).  
\- Other networks/pilots ongoing in: China, The Philippines, Japan, Indonesia, Singapore, Colombia, Chile and Israel.

**Share Price**

\- SPAC listing price $10 and now at $1.69 (5th of April).

Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here.

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

1431,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,Universal Health Services,84,45,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

1432,"The US Senate is now working to DELIST marijuana from the CSA, effectively legalizing it federally. ",wallstreetbets,Universal Health Services,1358,314,01-05-2024 07:31:48,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1chg776/the_us_senate_is_now_working_to_delist_marijuana/,"[Full Article](https://www.democrats.senate.gov/newsroom/press-releases/majority-leader-schumer-statement-on-deas-historic-step-to-reclassify-cannabis-as-less-harmful-drug)

The Cannabis Administration and Opportunity Act deschedules cannabis from the Controlled Substances Act entirely. This would effectively legalize cannabis at the federal level, removing many operational hurdles.

Then there‚Äôs the SAFER Banking Act, which will make it easier for companies to access capital, and to attract more large-scale investors. 

Rescheduling Cannabis to Schedule III is a game changer on its own. And, if either of these bills become law, we are talking multi-billion dollar market cap increases on some of the best positioned companies in the US (CGC in particular, but also TLRY in my opinion, due to the former's existing warrants to purchase cannabis companies in the US on rescheduling, and TLRY's penchant for expansion and acquisition).

My position: The Biden administration has gone through the bureaucracy of the Health and Human Services and now through the DEA to provide effective health and safety cover for the Senate's upcoming initiative.  This will put the Republican House in the spotlight, and my hope is that they will follow the position of their voters and pass the bill (but they have taken a fairly obstructionist position over the past 2 decades, so who knows, but they have extremely difficult headwinds on their horizon, so I think it looks good!)

When these bill are introduced, I would anticipate fairly significant upside market reactions. When they pass the Senate, we will see even more.  If the Republicans vote with the people and get it out of committee, we will see millionaires being created this year.

My recommendation:  BUY CALLS that expire in JAN 2025 to take advantage of this upside, while giving yourself enough time and room to weather the inevitable hills and valleys the market will go through while these bills make it through the Legislature.  Hold them, and wait.  They are still WAY UNDERPRICED in my opinion, given the rescheduling alone, and now with this news on the horizon.

Good luck everyone!

1437,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Valero Energy,38,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

1438,CVS got crushed so PNTG may soar,wallstreetbets,Ventas,84,45,05-05-2024 12:32:55,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1ckq8i2/cvs_got_crushed_so_pntg_may_soar/,"CVS awful quarterly earnings:
CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

1439,iOS 18 Prediction w/Verizon,wallstreetbets,Verizon,0,60,15-04-2024 01:05:14,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c49jmr/ios_18_prediction_wverizon/,"This oddly came to me in a dream like state but I swear somehow info from the future spilled into my mind! 

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods. (Yes your iPhone fully updated to 17.4.1 is still hackable, I have witnessed it myself firsthand, trust me Apple is aware and working on fighting this method being used!üòÄ) 

My prediction, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car, why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!! Buying a network/s would ensure 100% security methods being taken very seriously unlike our present system with telecom companies. Again just read T-Mobiles privacy page on Archive.org and you‚Äôll die inside ex: ‚ÄúThermal imaging Data‚Äù - No joke I screenshotted that one! ‚òùÔ∏è 

Switching to Verizon before June and/or investing in Verizon is good Wall Street bet. The next big thing is coming.. be ready.. "

I researched batteries at NASA. Okay it was an internship but shaddap.  I'm a chemist who loves batteries and solar energy, and ~~gambles~~ dabbles in stonks like a goddamn idiot. Here's a hot take on Enovix Corp, a little company that thinks it could revolutionize the battery game. Strap in, degenerates.

# TL;DR:

Enovix Corporation (ENVX) is possibly maybe trust me bro shifting from underdog to top dog in the advanced battery sector. They are making next-gen silicon-anode lithium-ion batteries with major potential in high-demand markets like smartphones and EVs. Despite hemorrhaging cash like a thing that hemorrhages a lot of cash, they just hit a revenue spike in Q4 2023. Yet stonk price is close to their 52-week low, and their Q1 report is coming up soon, Setting up a moonshot or setting up for a spectacular crash? Fuck if I know.

# Financials and stonk mommy moves:

* **Cash burn vs. rocket fuel**: Enovix has been burning cash faster than you can say ""bankruptcy,"" with some negative EBITDA and net income that might scare off the faint-hearted. The net income has shown increasing losses, from about -$40 million in 2020 to -$214 million by end of 2023.
* **Debt disaster**: The total debt significantly increased from virtually none in 2020 to $191 million in 2023. The debt is stacking up like a Jenga tower right before Ryan Gosling tells you to shut the fuck up.
* **Revenue rollercoaster**: After a long period of couch change revenue, they jumped up to $7.4 million in Q4 2023, which could be the beginning of something bigger.
* **Manufacturing muscle**: They‚Äôre expanding with a new high-volume manufacturing hub in Malaysia. It's supposed to be coming online this month.
* **Strategic alliances**: They‚Äôve got some hefty deals with top OEMs and a leading automaker *that shall remain nameless*, according to their most recent press release.

# Tech specs and market hype:

* **Battery breakthroughs**: They are producing batteries that have much higher capacity and longevity than what is currently on the market. At the same time, battery tech evolves at a breakneck pace, and competition is as brutal as Feyd-Rautha. Enovix needs to keep their edge sharp and scale efficiently without tripping over their own ambitions.
* **AI Demand Surge**: With AI tech slurping up power like a person who slurps up a lot of stuff, there‚Äôs a growing need for batteries. Enovix is stepping up, ready to provide more stuff to be slurped by the person slurping stuff.

# Bottom Line:

Enovix is swinging for the fences with high-stakes tech innovation and strategic expansions. It‚Äôs a textbook high-risk, high-reward play. They could be the garden gnome that wins the Iron Throne that tech investors have been praying for to lead the next big wave in battery technology. Or, they could go down in flames as a cautionary tale of overreach and under-delivery. Personally, I'm bullish and have shares and calls.

1. Ceo takes Ketamine
2. Ceo takes Ketamine (this is not a control c, control v mistake)
3. Pay-package related dilution expected (\~10%) and is another dumpster fire of a debate; possible shareholder revolt coming
4. QoQ negative growth of sales has materialized (first negative quarter)
5. Decrease in operating margins (read point 6)
6. Price wars in an oligopolistic industry are akin to a knife fight that nobody wants to walk away from. Also they are just beginning instead of ending (Li Autos decreased price today in response)
7. Robo-taxis are technologically very far away (the boy who cried FSD) and is a solution looking for a problem
8. Model 2 is axed (probably not profitable enough, the finance team is not stupid) so large TAM is chopped from valuation
9. Lay-offs, talent attrition and underutilized factories incoming, special hello to Gigafactory Berlin because EU EV sales are in negative growth
10. Ceo (this should be reason 1) has alienated it prime base i.e. democrats (look up recent WSJ article) which republican buyer growth hasn't materialized; they absolutely hate this guy in blue states
11. Ceo says the stock is in between waves of growth and also noted it was over-priced a few earnings ago
12. Ceo is not full-time and has many other pet projects like sending people to Mars
13. China is bank-rolling its EV makers (consipary theory) and their quality (BYD, Li Autos) is no joke at all (not a consipracy theory)
14. Trip to India delayed because it is not a game changer
15. No single product that could yield out-sized growth is less than 2 years away from commcercialization
16. Aging model line; one of the oldest fleet in market without face lift
17. At the end of the day, no car-marker will have 50% market share; humans like to think they are different and unique
18. Market is realizing it is not a tech company but a car company which are typically valued at 1/6 or 1/8th the price
19. Valuation was based on 50%+ growth which is a pipe-dream
20. Cash balance controlling for short-term liabilities is not great; if negative growth continues, the existing slight-above junk credit rating will worsen
21. They once had a robot product demo in which a human being pretended to be a robot; funny, they don't talk about that much anymore
22. Just laid-off the marketing team so no user conversion through education expected
23. Rivals have caught up with similar products and some like Ford/GM can rely on ICEs + Hybrids whose demand hasn't fallen as much; I would buy a BMW any day of the year over Tesla
24. Tesla forums on Reddit have a cult status where opposition can be banned. This show marks of irrationality which needs to be met with the timing of positive solvency

1444,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Vulcan Materials Company,197,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

Because I am not very familiar with the semiconductor chip industry, but have invested in various chip manufacturers in recent months, it seemed like a good idea to map out the chip manufacturing chain.  Interesting enough to share here since some, if not most, of the companies mentioned are discussed frequently here.

ASML, TSMC,  INTC, NVDA, SSNLF, QCOM, AVGO, AMD, ARM, AAPL,  GOOG, AMZN, and more.

The market initially didn't like the deal, sending EQT's stock tumbling - creating an undervalued opportunity that I pounced on around $34.

However, after taking a nice profit by exiting my position in the $36.80s, EQT has continued grinding higher, now stabilizing north of $37. A few factors seem to be pressuring the stock - excess natural gas supply, Biden's unfavorable energy policies, and an overall tough market backdrop for the sector.

That said, with EQT appearing to find its footing, I suspect the rebound could continue towards the $45 level. For now, I'm staying on the sidelines to watch the price action play out. But I may re-establish a position if we get another dip towards $36, although that may not materialize for a while.

The energy trade remains volatile, but EQT's beaten down levels presented an attractive risk/reward, especially as it hasn't run up compared to its other energy peers (of course given nat gas has continued to be depressed). "

In Q4 of 2023 McDonalds started to see faltering in previously strong growth citing consumer's rejecting their affordability as one of the main drivers.  This was one of the first signals that consumer pressure is starting to impact corporate grabs at margin which has continued as a theme through other major earnings calls:

Exhibit 1 PepsiCo: 

>In the U.S., lower-income consumers are still trying to stretch their paychecks, Pepsi CEO Ramon Laguarta told analysts on the company‚Äôs conference call. Pepsi is trying to target the demographic and keep them as customers, particularly for its snacks like Cheetos ü§¢.

  
Exhibit 2 Walmart:   


>The food business has a number that are showing up quite as well, so really key items that we know that our customers have responded to well. We took our French bread ü•ñ back to $1 which had been $1 for a long time and went up as inflation hit the market. And we're seeing results of that running about 40% over last year, so customers immediately responded. Rotisserie chicken üçó is another one. That price has come down by $1. Customers are responding.

  
It's becoming clear that Ameri-Fats  are not happy with the state of inflation and have been considering extreme measures like limiting their food intake to below 3000 calories a day.ü§¨This is a bad situation for u/ChrisKempzinski (CEO of McDonalds) and the world is waiting to see if he can present a plan to bring back actual value to the VALUE meal.   If McDonalds shows signs that it will cave to consumer pressure to possibly lose some ground on margins (or a supply chain optimization effort to accomplish the same thing) then it is likely we are going to start seeing larger movements in inflation in the coming months.   If Ameri-Fats start seeing strong offerings on Big Macs, Cheetos, and Rotisserie Chickens other competitors in the market will need to start looking at the 'greed' driven margins in their profits seriously.  

Everyone needs to stop worrying about trivial tech based dividendless goons who haven't innovated anything in years.   MCD is your true leading indicator and you don't even need to dump $50k on options before it comes out to make a profit.   Just wait for the report and look at their plans to address affordability and attract customers, if aggressive pricing is on the table then expect inflation to start showing major signs of progress and increased confidence of fed rate hikes THIS YEAR.    

Early confidence in Rate hikes means you can just YOLO into the Dow Jones with LEAPs and expect major profits before 2025.   "

1454,Ibotta IPO this Week- Thoughts?,wallstreetbets,Walmart,13,25,16-04-2024 04:55:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c57qh0/ibotta_ipo_this_week_thoughts/,"Hey all, first post here. I don't intend to make this a rigorous DD, but I'd like a few thoughts on Ibotta (soon to be IBTA on the NYSE). Their IPO is this week, and here are some notes (Source:  [https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-backed-ibotta-plans-ipo-8628185](https://www.investopedia.com/walmart-backed-ibotta-plans-ipo-8628185))  


1. Ibotta is making money, with 2023 profit at \~39 million. They were down at \~56 million in 2022. Somewhat surprising that they're becoming profitable; this industry is infamously hard to make money in. Companies like Honey mainly make their revenue through the ad space they sell on their coupon website and through kickbacks from the companies per used coupon volume.
2. Ibotta has a partnership with Walmart, which for a discount-friendly physical giant is nice to have. They're working on implementing AI to determine buyer preferences, though I remain unconvinced that this is better than what Walmart probably already has with their cyber division. Regardless, still a beneficial partnership both ways (Walmart increases customer loyalty/gets driven customers through Ibotta).
3. The IPO offering consists of a total of 5.625 million shares, of which  2.5 million shares are from the company, and 3.125 million shares sold  by existing shareholders. Ibotta is targeting $76-84, which I think is too much.

In my opinion, Ibotta is a good long-term buy due to promising profitability, but the IPO price is too damn high given the business fundamentals. I think we could expect $50 by Friday and $40 a week after. Since we don't have the stock available yet, I'll aim for 4/19 $55p. Thoughts, or am I very regarded?"

I also closed a tab in Chrome right before posting, so this is take two lol.

**Setting the Stage**

The [largest supermarket in these United States](https://www.statista.com/statistics/197899/2010-sales-of-supermarket-chains-in-the-us/) **Kroger, KR** has a $24.6 billion bid to merge with the second largest supermarket, Albertson's. Now I know what you're thinking, hey regard, what about Walmart and Costco? Now that's where things get more interesting. A trial set for August 26 will [determine if Walmart](https://www.wsj.com/business/retail/walmart-supermarket-kroger-albertson-merger-68e2478e) is in fact a supermarket, and holds the fate of Kroger and Albertson's in the palm of their hands. In the pacific northwest of Oregon, [the US Federal Trade Commission](https://news.bloomberglaw.com/litigation/ftcs-kroger-albertsons-merger-suit-set-for-trial-in-august) will determine if I can retire or not (JK, disclaimer I only own 33 shares of PECO and 100 shares of KR).

&#x200B;

**What the Hell is PECO?**

**PECO,** or Phillips Edison & Company, ""is one of the nation‚Äôs largest owners and operators of omni-channel grocery-anchored neighborhood shopping centers. PECO‚Äôs centers feature a mix of national and regional retailers selling necessity-based goods and services in fundamentally strong markets throughout the United States and its top grocery anchors include **Kroger**, Publix, **Albertsons**, and Ahold Delhaize. PECO remains exclusively focused on creating great omni-channel grocery-anchored shopping experiences and improving communities, one center at a time."" **I copy and pasted all of this.**

&#x200B;

**OK, Tell me More**

**PECO** is a REIT with a monthly dividend of $0.09 and a dividend yield of 3.44%. Now, here's where things either get interesting, or they don't because I don't know what I'm doing. Guess who PECO's two of their three largest tenants are? If you guessed Kroger, KR, and Albertsons, you are correct. **KR represent the largest percentage of PECO's** annualized base rent, while Albertson's represents the **third largest percentage of PECO's annualized base rent.**

[From PECO's most recent 10K](https://preview.redd.it/2sqmiaeu5qsc1.png?width=1526&format=png&auto=webp&s=d8b6631310007b7f4a463086364f79793a5350b6)

&#x200B;

**The Hypothesis**

I think that the FTC rules in Kroger's favor come August, states that Walmart is a supermarket, and allows the Kroger and Albertsons merge to move forward. I think this based on mostly gut feeling, which I'm told is the best way to make a trading and investment decision. If this happens, could both KR stock and the REIT PECO go soaring? That my friends, is for you to decide. Also, I used to work as a bagger at Kroger. "

LW missed earnings by a boatload as a surprise, blaming a transition to a new ERP system. 

‚ÄúThe transition to a new enterprise resource planning (ERP) system in North America negatively impacted our financial results in the quarter by more than we expected,‚Äù said Tom Werner, President and CEO. ‚ÄúThe ERP transition temporarily reduced the visibility of finished goods inventories located at distribution centers, which affected our ability to fill customer orders. In turn, this pressured sales volume and margin performance. While we are disappointed with the magnitude of the ERP transition‚Äôs effect on the quarter, after implementing systems adjustments and modifying processes, we believe the impact is behind us as our order fulfillment rates have normalized.‚Äù

The CEO says order fulfillment rates have been normalized.

*Risks:*
	‚Ä¢	Immediate financial and operational risks due to the ERP system transition.

While the outlook acknowledges impacts from the ERP system transition and a one-time charge for raw potatoes, the overall financial projections remain robust. These factors suggest a stable operational base with the potential for recovery and growth, marking a cautiously optimistic view for the company‚Äôs fiscal health in 2024.

Given the current financials and market position, LW appears to be in a temporary bearish phase due to the ERP transition but holds bullish potential for the long term.

Also, they are still facing a mountain of debt, albeit slightly less since they have basically stopped making movies and new TV shows since the strike. Should they ever start spending money again, they will probably struggle to find traction given their heavy cable TV footprint and struggle to gain traction in streaming.

Stock is down almost 10% today and even at $7.40 it feels like a value trap. If it gets down near $6 you are starting to see the company worth less than the sum of its parts and there might be value there. Otherwise avoid this one at all cost. "
1458,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,Waste Management,203,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

1460,Intel DD - Underbought and Oversold: Why You Should Be Investing In The AI Revolution's Cheapest Stock,wallstreetbets,Waters Corporation,654,439,12-04-2024 17:45:10,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c2ff3r/intel_dd_underbought_and_oversold_why_you_should/,"It's 2024 and Intel has not exactly performed admirably. While its competitors - AMD and NVIDA - have hit the moon and then some, Intel is still struggling along at around the price that it was prior to anyone knowing what ChatGPT was. If anyone had the massive foresight to invest in a chipmaker on the eve of the explosion in AI hype, they'd have been wrong to choose Intel. Problematic!

There are reasons for this, of course. Intel has not come out with a cutting-edge product - Nvidia's H100 has blown anything Intel's been able to offer out of the water. Intel has a notoriously dysfunctional corporate structure. Intel has been, since way before this subreddit existed, known for being a limp stock that trading sideways. China has been making noises about phasing out foreign chips. All these factors have prevented Intel from achieving the sort of green candlesticks that AMD and Nvidia sprouted as the implications of AI - and the vital role GPUs would play in powering it - became clear.

In spite of all this, I think Intel is a strong buy right now. Why?

For one, it's at a price we haven't seen in nearly a year. There's been a string of bad - but not structurally undermining - news coming out about the company recently, similar in form to the Gemini debacle that brought Google down to 133 a month ago. Google is now at 160, because AI is a hell of a thing to have in your column. The same dynamic is going to push Intel's price up. If you want that in technical analytic terms - RSI is below 30. Buy.

Intel is also catching up. [It's releasing a chip](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/intels-artificial-intelligence-ai-chip-085500073.html) that can beat the H100! That's not the whole story, of course - there's rumors that NVDA's latest Blackwell offering will be better than Intel's when they release it later this year. But demand for AI and the chips that power it is only spiking. We're even starting to see LLMs that can operate locally at the consumer level, which requires a lot of hardware. Nvidia's already selling out for years in advance - people aren't going to be able to get their hands on the most cutting-edge chips for a long, long time. And so Intel is going to end up with a shitload of demand in its lap. 

There's also the national security angle. Intel is the only major domestic chipmaker, and America has a considerable interest in ensuring that its domestic chipmaking capabilities are at least on par with other countries. Congress has already passed billions of dollars to domestic chipmaking efforts, and Intel will be a major beneficiary as it continues to dispense cash. 

Their earnings call is on 4/25, and so [here's my 4/26 call spread](https://imgur.com/a/kNWdyfT). I expect these to pick up a lot of IV as we get closer to 4/25. We're going to make a lot of money together, regards."

Here‚Äôs why you might wanna yolo into this bad boy:

&#x200B;

1.**Beating the Street:** Last quarter, FANG knocked it outta the park with an EPS of $4.74, beating estimates by $0.13. Revenue was up too, hitting $2.23 billion against the $2.16 billion expected. [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/) Consistency? Check.

&#x200B;

2. **Valuation Vibes:** With a trailing PE of 11.89 and a forward PE of just 11.37, FANG‚Äôs sitting pretty as potentially undervalued. This isn't some overpriced tech stock; it‚Äôs got the earnings chops to back up its price [(stockanylysis)](https://stockanalysis.com/stocks/fang/statistics/).

&#x200B;

3. **Institutional Love:** Big money‚Äôs been moving around here. Larson Financial Group and several other big players have been upping their stakes, a good sign of institutional confidence [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

4. **Dividend Delight:** FANG isn‚Äôt just about growth; it pays to hold, too. They recently bumped their dividend to a tasty $3.08 per share quarterly, which translates to a fat yield of 6.08% annually. That‚Äôs some serious cheddar while you wait for the stock to moon [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

5. **Future Forecast:** Analysts are seeing sunny skies ahead with EPS estimates climbing to $20.92 next year. If they're even close to right, we're looking at solid growth [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

6. **Technical Tea Leaves:** The stock has rallied over 30% YTD and recently traded around $202.58. It‚Äôs above both the 50-day and 200-day moving averages, a bullish sign for those of you who like your charts [(marketbeat)](https://www.marketbeat.com/instant-alerts/nasdaq-fang-sec-filing-2024-04-22/).

&#x200B;

Now, as with any oil play, there's volatility from oil price swings and market moods, but FANG seems positioned well. With earnings on the horizon, this could be a prime setup for a classic WSB YOLO. Remember, this ain‚Äôt financial advice, just one ape‚Äôs take on a stock that‚Äôs looking juicy. Manage your risk and maybe we ride this rocket together to the moon. üöÄ

&#x200B;

**TL;DR:** FANG‚Äôs got the goods‚Äîsolid earnings beat, undervalued stock, big dividends, and institutional backing. Could be time to strap in before earnings next week.

1463,Bitcoin Halving and the Brewing Storm in Crypto Mining: A Deep Dive,wallstreetbets,WEC Energy Group,30,38,18-04-2024 13:41:36,https://i.redd.it/bfq9lfppr8vc1.jpeg,"As most of you know, the Bitcoin halving is due in just a few days. This event, which occurs roughly every four years, is a built-in feature of Bitcoin that reduces the reward for mining new blocks in half. Currently, miners are rewarded 900 BTC per day, but post-halving, this will drop to 450 BTC. With Bitcoin's current valuation, this reward reduction could slash the industry's annual revenue by an estimated $10 billion. That's huge!

Previous halvings have historically led to significant price rallies for Bitcoin, which helped mitigate the reduced mining rewards. However, this time the context is different, and here‚Äôs why:

1. Increased Operational Costs: The mining difficulty has shot up nearly six times since the last halving, driven by a surge in the miner population chasing the same reward pie. Consequently, to stay competitive, miners are forced to invest in more expensive equipment, which is a hefty financial commitment.

2. Energy Cost Competition: Miners are also vying against deep-pocketed Big Tech firms for affordable electricity. These firms are investing heavily in AI and data centers, and utility companies prefer them over crypto miners for their stable financial outlook, leaving miners with higher electricity costs.

Now, here's the kicker. The increased skepticism around the profitability of crypto mining has led traders to place significant short bets against crypto mining stocks. Last I checked, the total short interest for a group of 15 crypto-mining stocks is hovering around $2 billion, representing almost 15% of these companies' available shares. To put that into perspective, it's three times the US market average short interest.

The market seems to be signaling a lack of confidence in the mining industry's ability to cope with the halving and rising operational costs. We're looking at a potential violent move up or a downturn in mining stocks, depending on how the situation unfolds.

It's time to go balls deep in $XPEV - the Tesla of China (without the lay-offs). Here's the DD from an industry observer who knows the market and the desperation of foreign OEMs:

They're also making power moves [in Europe](https://europe.autonews.com/automakers/xpeng-widens-europe-expansion) faster than the Zhukov in '45, giving the Germans a taste of their own medicine.

ü§ù **VW IS THIRSTY FOR XPEV**  üå≠  Volkswagen is so desperate for XPEV's tech, they're practically proposing marriage. Word on the street is that VW's entire electric lineup in China is gonna be powered by Xiaopeng's big brain energy.

The Beijing Auto Show starts on 4/25, so we're expecting **GIGANTIC** announcements for points 4 and 5 before and during the car show. The stock has been tanking harder than your portfolio during a crypto winter, but that's about to change, you paper-handed cucks.

**XPEV literally can't go tits up,** 'cause VW is gonna come to the rescue if shit hits the fan. I wouldn't be surprised if the Germans swallow XPEV whole with a tender offering in the near future, 'cause they're so desperate for that sweet, sweet EV tech. 

And if this is my last post, just know that the local regulator probably Jack Ma'd me. üòâ

1465,CPI report to be published on Wednesday morning. Wallstreet expects little to No progress against inflation,wallstreetbets,WEC Energy Group,58,26,10-04-2024 09:54:17,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c0hswh/cpi_report_to_be_published_on_wednesday_morning/," 

A big report from the Labor Department is coming out soon, and it‚Äôs expected to show that inflation‚Äîthe rising prices of goods and services‚Äîisn‚Äôt slowing down much. This news isn‚Äôt great for regular folks, investors, or even the government, because they all want to see prices rise more slowly. If prices aren‚Äôt going down, it might be harder for the Federal Reserve (the folks in charge of money stuff) to lower interest rates later this year, which can affect how much you pay for things like loans.

The report looks at something called the Consumer Price Index (CPI), which basically tracks how much stuff costs in the economy. It‚Äôs predicted that both the overall CPI and a version that doesn‚Äôt include the prices of food and energy will go up by about 0.3%. That means, on average, prices are expected to increase by 3.4% and 3.7% respectively over the year. These numbers are higher than what the government ideally wants, which is around a 2% increase.

Experts like Dan North, who‚Äôs a senior economist, don‚Äôt think we‚Äôre making enough progress to get inflation down to that 2% target. The report is due to come out at 8:30 a.m. ET, and it‚Äôs likely to show that we‚Äôre still far from reaching that goal.

Although inflation has come down from its peak in June 2022, when prices were rising more than 9%, progress has been slow lately. Even though the Federal Reserve raised interest rates 11 times between March 2022 and July 2023 to try to slow down inflation, it hasn‚Äôt made a huge difference. Prices haven‚Äôt changed much since they stopped raising rates, though some measurements show a slight improvement.

Aside from the Labor Department report, the Federal Reserve keeps an eye on another indicator called the personal consumption expenditures index (PCE). In February, it showed inflation at 2.5% overall and 2.8% if you leave out food and energy prices. This indicates that inflation is still a concern.

People who invest in the stock market are getting nervous too. Even though stocks did well at the start of the year, they‚Äôve been up and down recently because investors aren‚Äôt sure what to make of all this conflicting information.

Earlier this year, some investors thought the Federal Reserve would start lowering interest rates as soon as March and might keep doing it until 2024, making up to seven cuts. However, now it looks like any cuts might not happen until at least June, and there might be only up to three cuts, each just a small amount, according to calculations from the CME Group.

CVS reported earnings this week and they were horrendous.  The stock dropped 18% after release. The primary reason for the drop was a sharp increase in health care costs for their health insurance division.  Health care costs were $27.8 billion in Q1 2024 compared to $20.4 billion in Q1 2023.  This is a 36.3% increase. CVS covers 4.5 million Medicare Advantage members.  These members utilized medical care more than expected, according to CEO Karen Lynch.  

The Pennant Group:
The Pennant Group (PNTG) will release their earnings Monday after the bell. PNTG provides home health care services that are often paid for by Medicare Advantage plans. PNTG sends health care providers (registered nurses, nursing assistants, physical therapists) directly to the patient's home. 

Home health care is perfect for Medicare Advantage providers, like CVS.  This is because it provides an alternative to costly inpatient stays in hospitals and rehab facilities. 

The main point here is that there is likely to be a strong link between health care costs for Medicare Advantage providers (CVS) and revenue for home health care providers (PNTG).

Priced In(?):
Has this been priced in already?  It doesn't look like it to me.  PNTG is +1.3% (vs. SPY +1.5%) since CVS recently released earnings.  

But CVS isn't the first major insurance provider to tank recently on higher than expected medical costs.  Humana dropped 13% after their earnings were released in January. HUM is -32% in the past 6 months.  

While this increased utilization of health care by customers has been devastating for insurance providers, it has been an incredible tailwind for medical facility & care stocks.  In the past 6 months, HCA is +33%, THC +119%, and PNTG itself is +83%.

My point here is that while past bad news from insurance companies has been priced into PNTG, the new unexpected high medical costs reported by CVS do not appear to have been priced in.  They indicate continued, persistently high medical care utilization by Medicare Advantage members especially.

Senior Living:
PNTG also provides senior living facilities.  Occupancy rates across this industry have been surging recently.  Welltower (WELL)  and Ventas (VTR) are 2 of the biggest providers of senior housing.  Both have recently increased their yearly guidance in their Q1 2024 earnings report in part due to increasing occupancy rates.  

PNTG earnings are Monday 5/6 after the bell.  I'd appreciate any feedback.

1471,Boeing's whistleblower vs Tesla's Whistleblower: a tale of Two Companies,wallstreetbets,West Pharmaceutical Services,200,41,18-04-2024 08:03:21,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6xwmt/boeings_whistleblower_vs_teslas_whistleblower_a/,"Hello everyone

I am sure everyone has been reading about the two unfortunate whistleblowers from Boeing.

One allegedly committed suicide a few weeks ago [""John Barnett found dead in US""](https://www.bbc.com/news/business-68534703) , and his story goes back until 2019 when he said publicly:

*""In 2019, Mr Barnett told the BBC that under-pressure workers had been deliberately fitting sub-standard parts to aircraft on the production line. He also said he had uncovered serious problems with oxygen systems, which could mean one in four breathing masks would not work in an emergency. He said soon after starting work in South Carolina he had become concerned that the push to get new aircraft built meant the assembly process was rushed and safety was compromised, something the company denied.""*

He also felt he was in danger, and his fate will hopefully be clarified soon. 

Another Boeing whistleblower testified yesterday at the Senate ([FT article](https://www.ft.com/content/4cca756f-a9ad-486a-aa9f-af67b19071ec)), and this is what he said:

	*""A Boeing whistleblower testified to a US Senate committee that the aircraft manufacturer ‚Äúabsolutely‚Äù has a culture of retaliation against employees who raise safety concerns.*

*Sam Salehpour, a quality engineer at the company, said he was berated by a manager in response to repeatedly questioning the safety of the 777 and 787 aeroplanes. Separately, he said he found a nail suspiciously embedded in his car tyre.*

*‚ÄúI have raised these issues over three years,‚Äù he told the Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations at a hearing on Wednesday to examine Boeing‚Äôs safety culture. ‚ÄúI was ignored; I was told not to create delays; I was told, frankly, to shut up.‚Äù*

Sincerely I am not surprised that the US Senate is taking this seriously, as it relates to the safety of millions of people worldwide.

**TESLA'S whistleblower**

On a smaller scale, I wanted to bring up the story of another whistleblower, much more known in Europe than in the USA. The story was first published in May 2023 by a German newspaper called Handelsblatt, and then summarised by the New York Times in November 2023 in an article ""[Man vs Musk: a whistleblower creates headaches for Tesla](https://www.nytimes.com/2023/11/10/business/tesla-whistleblower-elon-musk.html) . The guy, L. Krupski, used to be a Tesla employee and hero as he put out a fire at a Tesla car delivery location, and Elon Musk thanked him in person.

Yet his colleagues started to mistreat him, and before leaving the company, L. discovered that from his work computer, he could have access to all the data of the company, including financials, product defections, and personal information of both employees and customers. He felt so concerned about what he saw that he decided later on to communicate the information to the German newspaper Handelsblatt ([here the original article](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/elektromobilitaet-mein-autopilot-hat-mich-fast-umgebracht-tesla-files-naehren-zweifel-an-elon-musks-versprechen/29166564.html)). Later on, also Reuters and CNBC covered a whistleblower dataset.

Overall, the information can be divided in 4 sections:

* Privacy data breach
* Cybertruck details and problems
* Product defects (faulty suspensions, autopilot/fsd problems, phantom braking etc.)
* Creative accounting & maybe financial fraud

**Privacy** Initially, Reuters and many western newspapers focused on the data breach issue. The trial mustbe ongoing but according to international observers from this breach alone Tesla might end up to pay 4% of its annual sales in fines. that is around $3.5 billion. See [Reuters article](https://www.reuters.com/business/autos-transportation/german-authorities-looking-into-possible-data-protection-violations-by-tesla-2023-05-25/) . Meta was once fined for a similar data breach. Most notably, Handelsblatt cross-checked the authenticity of the dataset by contacting some of the customers of Tesla, listed in the files.

**Cybertruck** Wired instead decided to focus on the design and manufacturing processes issues of the Cybertruck, publishing an article ""[""A leaked Tesla report shows the Cybetruck Had Basic Design Flaws""](https://www.wired.com/story/a-leaked-tesla-report-shows-the-cybertruck-had-basic-design-flaws/?utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter&utm_social-type=owned&mbid=social_twitter&utm_brand=wired) . In the article, it is said the truck took so many years to be finalised because its controversial design was literally an engineering nightmare. The article implied that the final price of the Cybertruck was for sure going to be higher than what was initially promised; indeed, at the launch, the price set by Musk was almost 100% higher than what he said many many years ago, and 50% less of the promised performance. Here is an article from the New York Post that confirms what Wired found out: [Tesla's Cybertrucks were rushed out, are malfunctioning at astounding rate""](https://nypost.com/2024/04/08/business/teslas-cybertrucks-were-rushed-out-are-malfunctioning-at-astounding-rate/)

**Product defections** this is the most interesting part of the dataset, as it seems that the customer complains on phantom braking and sudden unintended accelerations were much higher than what Tesla admitted over the years. It seems that employees were instructed to avoid leaving any written trace to customers about the defections, so that was unlikely for the company to be contested or sued. Also, Handelsblatt reports about thousands of unreported crashes with autopilot & FSD, with the customers being so scared of their cars that they preferred to sell it back to Tesla instead of selling it in the used car market. Handelsblatt published again an article in December, with the opinions of internal employees on the autopilot software: ""[Employees warned internally of potentially fatal autopilot errors""](https://www.handelsblatt.com/unternehmen/industrie/tesla-files-mitarbeiter-warnten-vor-potenziell-toedlichen-autopilot-fehlern/29530876.html) with employees saying:

*Erik Larsen\* was responsible for expanding charging stations in Scandinavia at Tesla. He publicly shares his enthusiasm for his employer and its goals on LinkedIn. After five unwanted braking events in just one week, Larsen was also skeptical: ‚ÄúI often turn off the autopilot because of the phantom braking.‚Äù*

*None of the employees found any valid explanations for the incidents. It remained just speculation. ‚ÄúI guess that deep shadows under bridges could also have something to do with it,‚Äù thought service technician Borja Clausen\* after his Tesla braked heavily while overtaking on the highway three times in three weeks. Engineer Jesper Thomassen\* wrote: ‚ÄúI experience incorrect braking almost every time I drive and hard phantom braking less often, but usually a few times on my longer weekend trips in different places.‚Äù*

Reuters later in December published a report on the fact that Tesla was aware of its faulty suspensions, mostly about the MX & MS lineups, but customers sometimes complained about the MY & M3 suspensions. Most notably, Tesla recalled the faulty vehicles in China, but it did not do anything in the West. Here is the article: [""Tesla blamed drivers for failures of parts it long knew were defective""](https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/tesla-musk-steering-suspension/) 

Again, Musk refused to comment on this. If you read the article, the reports are indeed alarming:

*""Two more complex and expensive parts also frequently failed: half shafts ‚Äì the left and right drive axles ‚Äì and steering racks, which often needed replacing after sudden power-steering outages that some Tesla owners said nearly caused accidents. One driver said in an interview that his brand-new 2023 Model Y jerked to the right when the power-steering suddenly failed at speed, nearly putting the vehicle into a ditch.*

*At least 11 drivers told Tesla a crash was caused by a failure in the suspension, steering or wheel assembly, company records show. Those accident claims, which have not been previously reported by the media, were recorded by Tesla staff between 2018 and 2021 and assigned to engineers or technicians for review.""*

A similar issue was noticed and reported by a Swedish guy in July 2022 [https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/](https://carup.se/larmade-om-farligt-fel-fredriks-film-stoppad-av-teslas-advokater/) The crazy part of this is that people noticed the issue already in 2016, but nothing has been done to solve it (Tesla just recalled the cars in China) [https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/](https://dailykanban.com/2016/06/08/tesla-suspension-breakage-not-crime-coverup/)

**Financials** The most interesting and controversial part of the dataset was reported by CNBC in October 2023 with the article [Tesla whistleblowers filed a complaint to the SEC in 2021, but the agency never interviewed them. Here's what the complaint said](https://www.cnbc.com/2023/10/12/tesla-whistleblowers-filed-complaint-to-sec-in-2021-what-it-said.html?taid=652828810c82f000011cc7d8&utm_campaign=trueanthem&utm_medium=social&utm_source=twitter%7Cmain)

* about warranty repairs: From what is reported, it seems that Tesla increased its short-term profits by setting aside less money for future repairs. According to some estimates  (Bradmuchen report on substack), Tesla has the lowest warranty expenses as a % of COGS, despite its many defections. Additionally to setting aside less money for future repairs, Tesla books the cost of repair under general and administrative costs, and the customer bill is billed as revenue. *‚ÄúWhere you put stuff in a financial statement matters,‚Äù she said. ‚ÄúIf I‚Äôm taking warranty costs out of the cost of automotive sales, and pushing them down into some other line further down the income statement, that will make my gross profit margin look higher. If I‚Äôm moving it from up above in cost of sales, and moving into other expenses, it‚Äôs also not as transparent about the quality of the product.‚Äù*
* accountancy of new car sales: ""*In another example, the complaint said screenshots showed Tesla employees had manually changed the status of ‚Äúused‚Äù cars to ‚Äúnew‚Äù in a program that tracked vehicle deliveries data. This could affect Tesla‚Äôs delivery numbers, they said, though they didn‚Äôt try to estimate the overall impact and instead encouraged the SEC to investigate further. ""*  I am not sure Tesla can do this (if they ever did) as the state incentives make it impossible to fake the sale of a used car as new, just to make the delivery report look better""
* inventories value assessment: ""*In one example, the tipsters said screenshots showed other Tesla employees changed the status of material used in manufacturing from ‚Äúscrap‚Äù to ‚Äúwork in progress.‚Äù Scrap refers to material generated from a manufacturing job that is unusable waste.""* Again, in order to increase profitability, scrap parts might have been upgraded to Work-in-progress parts, just to avoid decreasing short-term margins. [Back in 2019](https://twitter.com/BradMunchen/status/1306909890586107904), some short sellers already had the impression that Tesla inventories were not that transparent  

It seems the SEC was not interested in the Whistleblower findings, and they refused to meet with them despite their many findings.

**CONCLUSIONS** It is unclear to me why Elon says that medias are against him, as everyone could have widely reported this story and yet, after the first articles, nobody ever mentioned it. 

Handelsblatt and Reuters confirmed the authenticity of the dataset, that's why Tesla never sued them, but actually sued the whistleblowers in Norway and Texas [https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901](https://www.bankinfosecurity.com/tesla-sues-2-former-employees-over-insider-data-breach-a-22901) It is unclear to me if the Norwegian whistleblower is the same source of the USA ones, and it could be very worrisome if different parties ended up with the same bunch of information.

Why do you think we hear about Boeing's whistleblowers but not the Tesla's ones?

These are personal opinions. I am not an insider to any tickers or companies named in this post.*

(Note: I know that I am massively wrong about my predictions with SPY and QQQ in a [previous post](https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/17owsky/dd_scary_fast_to_a_recession_next_year/), but the AAPL prediction did come true? See P.S. below for more details)

# Introduction

""If he sends reinforcements everywhere, he will be everywhere weak."" - Sun Tzu

As mentioned in a previous post, Apple (AAPL) is currently trying to defend its market position in multiple fronts:

1. Lagging hardware sales in Macs and iPads globally, which compose Apple's ecosystem beyond the iPhone
2. The Greater China Region in general, which is the iPhone (and other products') #2 market, only behind the US itself
3. Services and Software, which serves as an engine for growth amid aforementioned plateauing and stagnating hardware sales, are currently engaged in legal entanglements with the EU and the US

There is a great breadth of markets, both product and geography-wise, listed above. But Mr. (Let Him) Cook is only one chef: if there can only be a single story for a coherent market defense, a single place where he can go on a charm defensive, where will it be?

It will have to be in China, where all of the decelerating markets stated above intersect: [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-boss-tim-cook-visiting-shanghai-2024-03-20/)

However, the main point of the trip seems to be something else entirely - Apple Vision Pro (II): [Reuters](https://www.reuters.com/technology/apple-vision-pro-hit-mainland-china-this-year-state-media-says-2024-03-24/)

Surely the Apple CEO himself wouldn't have the wind in his sail on the sea, just to lead with AVP in order to make AAPL strong?

# Supply Chain + Product + Market: Tim Cook's magic.

Long ago, Steve Jobs said that ""If It Weren't For Tim Cook, The iPad Would Have Cost $5,000."": [BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/if-it-werent-for-tim-cook-the-ipad-would-have-cost-5000-2012-3)

In terms of product market fit, the iPad is:

1. A great companion device, especially if a large screen is needed in a constrained space
2. Is mostly made for content consumption, but can do content creation with add-ons or in a pinch
3. Not as convenient as an iPhone in being ""an iPod, a phone, and an internet communicator""

Guess which product also does the above, currently costs in the ballpark of ""$5000"", and is not yet blessed with Tim's Magic?

I think most of you here can guess (although I have doubts if I say ""all""): **the** **AVP today has components mostly sourced in Japan**: [Nikkei](https://asia.nikkei.com/Business/Technology/Apple-Vision-Pro-teardown-Japanese-companies-supply-40-of-parts)

I doubt Tim went to China himself just to secure a second market to a niche device; he went to secure a supply chain to continue making global devices, both AVP and existing products.

# The Magic Is No More: The Journey (Back) to the West

However, I don't think Tim Cook has made any headway with China: shortly after Tim Cook's trip, Apple suddenly pivots to the Enterprise market: [Apple PRFAQ](https://www.apple.com/newsroom/2024/04/apple-vision-pro-brings-a-new-era-of-spatial-computing-to-business/)

This pivot, to me, smells of inadequate supply chain scale. Coupled with the fact that his next destinations were Vietnam and Indonesia, suggests that the talks in China, both from the supply and the market side, have reached relative deadlock: [APNews](https://apnews.com/article/vietnam-apple-tim-cook-supply-chain-e9a7581a127937a1958bebd434a47f25) [Quartz](https://qz.com/apple-ceo-says-company-is-looking-at-manufacturing-in-i-1851415116)

# M4: Loaded with AI or merely smokes and mirrors?

In another attempt to revive Mac sales, Apple is revamping its Mac lines with its new M4 chip, now with a ~~rushed~~ accelerated release date. However, I don't think it will make as big of a splash as hoped.

AI chips have two primary markets:

* **Enterprise**: Good luck with Apple on that, both in terms of internal culture and external competition / legal constraints - it would be a flagrant evasion of sanctions if M4 Mac Minis were suddenly all the rage in China.
* **Personal**: My current bottleneck is having more than 8gb RAM in my Macbook without selling my plasma, not a faster chip.

Given that Apple's R&D spend is 22b as of Aug2023 ([BusinessInsider](https://www.businessinsider.com/tim-cook-apples-ai-research-spend-generative-2023-8)) with little to show thus far, it's very difficult to how Apple's current strategy is little more than just bandwagoning: Tim's behavior is looking more and more similar to the knee-jerk reactions made by other tech CEO's, particularly Sundar's.

# In conclusion

AAPL 5/17 165 Puts x 10

Target price on downside seems to be \~155 by earnings call based on volume spike on 5/3 155 Puts: [YahooFinance](https://finance.yahoo.com/quote/AAPL/options/?straddle=true&date=1714694400)

My current view is that Apple will not be able to execute on an AI-based ecosystem in order to differentiate its hardware to an ever-evolving software landscape, as that would require relinquishing too much control over its own platforms (see WebKit, Siri, sideloading, default apps, you name it), and its current product line will continue to stagnate as others rapidly commoditize and even out-innovate it in a challenging legal and market landscape.

*P.S.: Last time I posted, the markets pumped due to Powell doing an interest rate victory lap (dotplot these nutz), which has now failed to materialize. I excitedly await the spectacle that comes next as 10Y3M reverts and unemployment slope goes back up and reaccelerates.*"
1473,Ramblings of a Remora: The size of the future AI market is truly hard to fathom and it's impact hard to imagine.,wallstreetbets,Western Digital,8,14,05-04-2024 18:40:19,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bwpl5n/ramblings_of_a_remora_the_size_of_the_future_ai/,"It begins as a ""tool"", an artificial intelligence marketed as an innovative solution designed to make your job easier, less stressful, less time consuming. Sounds great to your average person until you realize that it ends with a handful of competing Megacorps, each in control of an advanced intelligence like Tony Stark's Jarvis and all willing do whatever it takes to keep their precious AI dominant.  That may be a stretch, but the following certainly isn't.

Consider the rise and fall of Blockbuster, helped along by the emergence of Netflix's disruptive first business model - DVDs mailed straight to the customer's doorstep for a fraction of the cost. In a decade, an American tradition - the act of jumping into the family van for a trip to pick out a new movie and grab your favorite candy had disappeared. Then, Netflix further evolved their business, going completely digital. Then they evolved again, announcing that they were going to invest several billions of dollars into producing their own original content. Many were quick to call the decision a gamble at the time but it's clearly paid off for the tech giant. So what's the next step for the streaming companies of the world, you ask?

The death of Hollywood as we know it.

Consider this, your great-grandchildren might not even watch the same films or play the same video games as their friends, simply because the size of available content will veer towards infinity. Much like it does now, your favorite streaming service (or its future-day equivalent), will present you with a list of titles you might enjoy watching, but they won't be real films - at least not films that any real person has made. And they'll all be curated to your pleasure. Try explaining the ""list of movies you might enjoy"" to your wife when she accidentally logs into your profile.

Imagine anyone of your favorite streaming services now has the ability to invest billions into Generative AI. Eventually, and sooner than you think, there is going to be an AI that can write a full-length movie script (or even an entire series), generate fake movie stars who appear indistinguishable from real actors as they appear on screen, and create compelling, heart-wretching scenes with lifelike reality - all within mere seconds. And the content will be available to billions of consumers on the fly. In not so many years from now, Mission Impossible 20 won't cost $300 million to produce and it's release date won't be impacted by delays caused by Covid-30. The newest, big action film will cost no more than the energy it takes for your thumb to hit the *Randomize* button. Billions, trillions, an infinite number of AI generated films will be available at your fingertips and watchable at any given moment. Video games too.

The Timotay Chamalays of the world today are going to be some of the last *real* stars our great-great grandchildren see. There will always be stars of course, but they won't be real.

So where does this leave you, the less than average investor? You know the remora, that little fish that attaches itself to sharks? That's your best hope, chum. The ""largest"" transfer of wealth that happened during covid is going to seem small in comparison to the upcoming transfer - the big one. The big one will be a result of exponential, AI-driven growth and it will usher in a new list of AI tycoons whose wealth and notoriety dwarf that of the old money families.

People laugh at how outlandish a $25 trillion dollar valuation is for Nvidia, but I do think we will see companies valued at ten, or even in the tens of trillions by the mid 2030s.

For a minute or two, imagine a future where the majority of jobs have been replaced by AI alternatives and profit margins are soaring. Then imagine a little further into the future, when even those jobs that were once the most physically degrading like surgeons, and those requiring intense concentration and skill like hookers, have also been replaced by robots, humanoid or other. How will you feed your family when there is a robutt that's made yours obsolete in comparison?

You'll hope that whichever Megacorp presides over your geographic region is generous with their distribution of resources, and pray that they feed you not because they are required by law to maintain a certain mortality rate, but rather, that AI's growth has been stewarded into a new utopian western civilization - one in which all can prosper.

On another note, Evercore ISI has also released a pessimistic outlook on Netflix being unable to exceed investor expectations for core subscriber count.

1476,"How to Profiteer off of War, A Brief",wallstreetbets,Williams Companies,38,34,09-04-2024 17:19:43,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bzxoi0/how_to_profiteer_off_of_war_a_brief/,"The war between Russia in Ukraine is bad for those people... But there is money to be made.

This war has been a bit of a black-box. Both sides have been overstating the effectiveness of their troops while understating losses, especially Russia. This is why we should listen more keenly to third party sources, especially when they say that Ukrainian drone strikes have destroyed possibly up to 15% of Russian oil refining capacity:

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-strikes-may-have-hit-15-russian-refinery-capacity-nato-official-2024-04-04/)

First, I want to explain the scale of these strikes. 15% may not sound like a lot, but these refineries are massive industrial wonders of the modern world. The size of cities, technology that literally came from aliens. These cannot be repaired easily, especially while Russia is at war and heavily sanctioned. Plus, these refineries have a known capacity and are expected to output this number of refined oil every day without ceasing. Any strike to global oil refining is felt. Russia makes lots of this shit. And Ukraine fucking hates it. They can't use foreign drones on these refineries because we (the US) are pussies and don't want to escalate this conflict. But they started making their own drones. A million.

[https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/](https://www.reuters.com/world/europe/ukraine-produce-one-million-drones-next-year-zelenskiy-says-2023-12-19/)

Even if only 10% of these drones hit a target and they only target refineries 1% of the time, that is 1,000 refinery impacts. And at this time they've only hit like less than 10. So 15% is a big deal, is likely understated, is of long duration, and will get higher.

What does this mean for our pockets? Well, obviously, the price of refined oil will increase. Commodities are tough to trade. Also we can't leverage them as easy. Commodities are complicated as fuck, and entirely unpredictable. I am not a senator or an oligarch but if you are feel free to take these bozo's money. I don't trade commodities, so IDGAF. Oil refining companies, though, DGAF (Do give a fuck). They have reported record margins as of late:

[https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/](https://www.reuters.com/business/energy/valero-kicks-off-us-refiners-first-quarter-earnings-with-profit-2022-04-26/)

To be clear, the reduction in global capacity for oil REFINING is what matters. Yes, Ukraine is fucking up Russia's bridges, boats, pipes, and asshole. However if the war ends, this shit (production) gets fixed near instantly. Production is easy and quick to fix compared to refining. Betting against Russian oil production will possibly lose us all our money and I would have to sell my Funko pops.

**So** we want to find a player that does either refining or drilling, but NOT BOTH. Here's my 6 second analysis of the largest US Oil refiners, parentheses is thousand barrels per day:

ExxonMobil Baytown, Baton Rouge, Beaumont (1455): Yes it's a lot of oil, but they are also heavily involved in oil drilling/exploration which is less efficient for our money.

Motiva Enterprises (626) : Private

Premcor (335): Owned by Valero, which does drilling

WRB Refinery (356): Private

Tesoro (363): Owned by marathon, see below

Marathon Petroleum Galveston, Garyville (1189): **Buy this shit, but sell the other half**

**This was my moment of revelation:** Marathon has two publicly traded companies:

1. Marathon Petroleum Corporation(MPC)- Marathon Petroleum Corporation is an American petroleum refining, marketing, and transportation company headquartered in Findlay, Ohio. The company was a wholly owned subsidiary of Marathon Oil until a corporate spin-off in 2011.
2. Marathon Oil Corporation (MRO)- Marathon Oil Corporation is an American company engaged in hydrocarbon exploration incorporated in Ohio and headquartered at 990 Town and Country Boulevard in Houston, Texas.

**This is perfect you fucking nincompoops.** The company split it's refining and drilling.

I already bought my shares of MPC in my IRA, sticking with that for at least several years, or until the headwinds for foreign oil refining end. Don't really care about this one, not hype. Buy it if you are smart and level-headed and gay. I will not explain, but option plays here are autistic.

MRO is another story. Short term (Expiring late June) puts on this one are a safe 2-4 bagger in my dumb opinion. That means 2x-4x if you are normal. Cartel economics are involved, but here's the summary. Yes Russia wants to sell their crude because they can't refine it, but they can't. They are heavily sanctioned and Ukraine pushing their infrastructural shit in. OPEC currently is saying they will cut production of crude until June. That is why crude is up, MRO is up, and everyone expects it to stay up for a long while. Pop fucking quiz, why is OPEC cutting production? Because it thinks Russia is cutting production. Russia isn't, remember it's being bombed. Millions of kamikaze drones are coming for Russian infrastructure. Once OPEC realizes that Russia isn't purposefully cutting production, crude will be at $85-100 per barrel. OPEC minus Russia will then reap the harvest that Russia helped sow. Oops there goes the price of crude. Look up Cartel Economics William Spaniel on YT if you can focus for 30 minutes. It gets even better:

There are two rocket ship scenarios. The first, a surprise OPEC production boost. If this happens before June, it is unexpected. Free volatility. Big bagger. Who knows maybe they change their mind?

The second, if the war ends, Russia has a fuck-ton of oil in storage. The storage is full, and more oil is being pumped with nowhere to go. They will rebuild the crude outflows within a month and flood the market with oil. Russia is cash starved. It's population is suffering from the war, Vlad will want to treat them to some GDP and oil money.

Either or both of these rise us up to above a 10 bagger on our puts IMO. This shit would spike up so quick. If these scenarios occur, sell on the volatility.

Now, I bought lots of these puts they are cheap as fuck I can control thousands of shares for less than what I spend on Funko pops each month. I'm holding 100 MRO Puts 6/21 expiry.

My adderall is wearing off. I have some information all tied together about crude oil, trains, Galveston, and an eensie-weensie company that will love the war. When my shrink gives me a refill I will continue. Legal disclosure: I have an IQ of under 85. Toodaloo\~!"
1477,ENVX - Enovix Silicon Battery Manufacturer - Show Me Story That‚Äôs Proving It,wallstreetbets,W. W. Grainger,33,25,04-05-2024 00:16:44,https://i.redd.it/t2x7px8pyayc1.jpeg,"The key takeaways from earnings/recent highlights:

Achieved 95% yields from the Gen 2 manufacturing equipment during Factory Acceptance Testing.

Enovix announced it has been granted 15-year Pioneer Status from the Malaysian Investment Development Authority, MIDA, for manufacturing its batteries in Malaysia. Effectively this is a tax abatement. 

Site Acceptance Testing will be complete during 2Q24.

Minimum throughput for Gen 2 is 1350 units per hour is confirmed but they already tested at 1650 units per hour.

Signed a development agreement with a top 5 cellphone OEM.

Sampling to 6 of 8 top cellphone OEMS.

EX-1M w/ 18% more energy density vs graphite will ship 2Q24. EX-2M is expected to increase by 30% and will ship before year end 2024.

Anticipate further cost reductions of 35MM per year and Gen 2 cost will go down as more lines are added.

On the earnings call the Chief Financial Officer commented, they have a long runway before they‚Äôd need to raise capital and they wouldn‚Äôt do it at the current stock price. Nor would the board allow it.

He also mentioned they‚Äôve gotten unsolicited interest from governments and Sovereign Wealth Funds indicating a desire to provide funding if Enovix sets up a fab in their country. 

* Added info: this is a show me story that continues to de-risk as management continues to deliver. Despite that there is an intransigent short base that is approximately 30% of the float currently.

Nothing makes sense right now, and here is what I mean by that:

* [40% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last four years](https://www.federalreserve.gov/releases/h6/h6_technical_qa.htm). While many have seen the figure that [80% of the total M1 money supply has been created in the last 4 years](https://fred.stlouisfed.org/series/M1SL), it is important to note that the FED changed the definition of M1 in May 2020. However, this is still a staggering figure, and it keeps going up - this is not sustainable.
* [Americans have lost 25% of their purchasing power in the last four years](https://truflation.com/dashboard?feed=truflation-us-aggregated). Your money sitting over the last four years has lost 25% of its value. For some people, they are blessed to say ""wow, my savings are losing value""; however, for the majority of Americans living paycheck to paycheck ([\~78%](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.forbes.com/advisor/banking/living-paycheck-to-paycheck-statistics-2024/%23:~:text%3Dor%2520lost%2520income.-,How%2520Many%2520Americans%2520Are%2520Living%2520Paycheck%2520to%2520Paycheck%253F,paying%2520for%2520their%2520monthly%2520expenses.&ved=2ahUKEwjL-dSR8d6FAxW8kIkEHS12D30QFnoECBEQAw&usg=AOvVaw2DCmZpPIP8emMe4iWmXTW8)), this means they can no longer afford 25% of what they used to be able to. Or rather, they can only afford 75% of what they used to be able to, as wages have not even remotely kept up. When you lose 25% of your purchasing power and live paycheck to paycheck, you are forced to adjust your lifestyle or take on incremental debt. 
   * Off the last bullet, [credit card debt is at an all time high](https://www.cbsnews.com/news/credit-card-debt-record-high/), and [credit card delinquency is worst on record](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-10/credit-card-delinquency-rates-were-worst-on-record-in-fed-study?embedded-checkout=true). Here are some quick stats: 49% of credit card holders carry a balance month to month, credit card delinquencies have soared more than 50% in the past year, and 6.4% of all accounts are now 90 days past due, and the average credit card annual percentage rate is at a record 20.74%.
   * Further, [buy now pay later (""BNPL"") service usage hit an all time high this past holiday season](https://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&rct=j&opi=89978449&url=https://www.cnbc.com/2024/01/21/buy-now-pay-later-shoppers-deal-with-holiday-debt.html%23:~:text%3DDuring%2520the%2520season%252C%2520buy%2520now,nearly%252043%2525%252C%2520Adobe%2520said.&ved=2ahUKEwicy7K_9N6FAxVAhIkEHRLMB58QFnoECA8QAw&usg=AOvVaw0Gm5tpilHUFvMEbNeu8NnN). 
   * Finally, [78.9% of federal student loan balances are on forbearance or default status as of 4/18/2024 which accounts for 71.5% of borrowers](https://www.forbes.com/advisor/student-loans/average-student-loan-debt-statistics/).
* [Basics like food are up multiples](https://www.ers.usda.gov/data-products/chart-gallery/gallery/chart-detail/?chartId=58350). No need to explain further, we have all been to the grocery store and felt this.
* Homes are completely unaffordable / [the cost of buying a home has hit an all time high](https://investors.redfin.com/news-events/press-releases/detail/1090/redfin-reports-buying-a-home-costs-more-than-ever-with), as such, home ownership is becoming less feasible and millennials / Gen Z are not building equity in what has historically been American's most valuable asset.
* [Child care is skyrocketing](https://finance.yahoo.com/news/the-threat-that-high-childcare-costs-pose-to-the-us-economy-124248273.html). The [U.S. Department of Health and Human Services (HHS)](https://www.federalregister.gov/documents/2016/09/30/2016-22986/child-care-and-development-fund-ccdf-program) states that child care is considered affordable when it costs families no more than 7% of their household income; however, that figure is roughly 24%. [Bank of America said the average childcare payment per household has risen over 30% since 2019 for its customers](https://institute.bankofamerica.com/economic-insights/rising-childcare-costs.html). We are at a point where some families are determining if they are better off to become a single income household versus a dual income household with child care.
* While the USD still remains the most dominant force (by a significant margin), regardless of opinion on sanctions, sanctions typically lead to weakening the USD. Further, nations are considering moving away from the USD more now than ever before. So much so that [political candidates are discussing potential penalties for nations that move away from the USD](https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2024-04-25/trump-advisers-discuss-penalties-for-nations-that-de-dollarize?embedded-checkout=true). 
* [GDP missed estimates this morning at 1.6% versus estimates of 2.2%](https://www.barrons.com/livecoverage/us-gdp-first-quarter-report).
* Finally, not to mention all of the chaos going on in the world right now. Conflict in Eastern Europe, conflict in the Middle East, the US border crisis, China & Taiwan, etc.

All the while, we are being told that everything is fine! There is nothing to worry about! This is the soft landing we have been looking for, and inflation is normalizing...right? I mean even the stock market recently hit an all time high. [Janet Yellen said it herself today, despite the GDP miss, the US economy is firing on all cylinders](https://www.marketwatch.com/livecoverage/gdp-report-first-quarter-numbers-expected-to-show-strong-u-s-growth-continuing/card/yellen-says-u-s-economy-firing-on-all-cylanders-despite-gdp-miss-jumOOgWIaDKmTFzTj2ub). I know this is my opinion, but I am looking around and things are not adding up. It doesn't make sense, and I do not think that this is sustainable.

During the euphoria phase, it‚Äôs not uncommon to see the major indices up 6, 7, 8 trading days in a row, while individual stocks are up 10, 11, 12, 13 days in a row. 

During the depression phase, it‚Äôs the complete opposite: the S&P 500 has sold off for 6 straight days, while many individual stocks e.g. Dave & Buster‚Äôs (PLAY) is down 12 days in a row, and Overstock/Beyond (BYON) has only had 1 green day w/minuscule gain in April thus far, following a 13-day losing streak.

It‚Äôs not just a matter of very high & very low RSI readings, but once the algos identify a trend, they seem to blindly follow it and squeeze out every last penny until they can‚Äôt anymore.

I was looking at historical trade data over the rise & fall of the first internet bubble, ie \~1995‚Äì2002, and to my surprise, this type of behavior was not at all common back then. The aggregate gain (\~1000%) and loss (\~90%) were massive, but every few days, the trend would reverse. 

For example, Internet bubble poster-child Cisco (CSCO) gained +3%, 4%, 1%, 2% and 3% in the 5 trading days between June 15-21, 1999, then fell 3% and 2%. 

Swing traders could easily make money both on the way up, and on the way down, as price actions moved more like zigzags than straight lines. This is no longer the case in modern-day, algo-driven markets."

iOS 18 is going to be the most secure iOS to date using AI heavily to protect the device and its code from being hacked via present methods. (Yes your iPhone fully updated to 17.4.1 is still hackable, I have witnessed it myself firsthand, trust me Apple is aware and working on fighting this method being used!üòÄ) 

My prediction, if you haven‚Äôt noticed already Verizon is very Apple oriented with their plans. WHAT IF the AI was a carrier specific option?! Not only would the network be more secure by utilizing AI but it would make Verizon stand out in ways they missed in 2007 when AT&T took on the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù. 

AI in an iPhone is the ‚Äúnext big thing‚Äù and I don‚Äôt think Verizon would pass this opportunity up at this point. Now if I‚Äôm correct Apple could choose its protected networks worldwide that align with their privacy policies. (Glares are T-Mobile privacy policy page from archive.org) 

This could be a 51% buyout in Verizon as well? Apple gave up on the car, why? To keep pursuing the iPhone!! Buying a network/s would ensure 100% security methods being taken very seriously unlike our present system with telecom companies. Again just read T-Mobiles privacy page on Archive.org and you‚Äôll die inside ex: ‚ÄúThermal imaging Data‚Äù - No joke I screenshotted that one! ‚òùÔ∏è

Grainger,139,44,14-04-2024 21:14:43,https://i.redd.it/n3hfucowgiuc1.jpeg,"I used a baccarat board to chart the daily SPX returns from Monday, Jan 1, 2024 to Friday, April 12 to see if any discernible pattern. The results are quite interesting as a baccarat player.


The Blue Player wins are if SPX was up from previous day. Red Banker wins are if SPX was down from previous day. I did not put a threshold for ""ties"" or trim for any order of magnitude. So, if we were up merely 0.01% from previous day, that still counts as a Player win. For perspective, the absolute value of average 1D deltas this year was +/- 0.56%. 


So if I were to place some bets for the next 2 days (Monday and Tuesday), the bottom 2 rows on the bead plate chart (table on right) looks like strong pattern for Player to hit the next 2 days!

The caveat is that we were in a massive bull run so if we continue trending down, this wouldn‚Äôt be obvious here, but other charts indicate we‚Äôve got a bit more juice left for a week or 2 of upside before we crash 10% to sub $500 on SPY.

* Recently oversold due to complex financial changes / maneuvering

It didn‚Äôt help when Covid came in and slammed into their bottom-line. I found out it got so bad that apparently the owner, this guy named ‚ÄúDanny W. Meeks‚Äù was an alderman in the Portsmouth city council. When his business needed him though he resigned (fucking respect). Which is something that most politicians really don‚Äôt do, especially when shit hits the fan, so yeah, I respected that a lot. The company is a small business, it‚Äôs so fucking small that I didn‚Äôt even know a company like this one could be traded on the stock market, neither did the nasdaq because they unironically tried to delist them, thankfully the Meeks was able to postpone this by showing that the company could meet the ‚Äúbare minimum‚Äù so now he has a 180 day long deadline apparently to bring the stock price up to 1 dollar I believe. I don‚Äôt think he‚Äôs going to fucking do it (even though there is a little bit of volatility in the companies history). This isn‚Äôt financial advice, but I hope they do. I might invest a small portion of my portfolio/paycheck into this company over time just to support small business. I feel fucking bad for this dude, it‚Äôs not an easy thing to do, especially after corona. It hurts me even more since my father is a truck driver, my hats off to the guy, even if I feel like the financials look kind of like doo doo (negative cash flow üíÄ) I like this dudes drive and because of that I like the stonk. üòé"
1508,Is there a reason why Newegg is so insanely low?,wallstreetbets,W. W. Grainger,0,48,09-04-2024 18:58:26,https://i.redd.it/yuxn15a14itc1.jpeg,"I‚Äôve looked through their available earnings reports, balance sheets, etc., and sure, none of those things make the company look particularly attractive, but they seem to still be kicking, at least somewhat. Are investors just not interested since the lockdown ATH? 

I posted the options interest below. I was hoping it might shed some light on sentiment. Mostly the people trading these don‚Äôt seem too pessimistic but my impression is that sentiment is overall MEH. 

Short interest is about 3.8% of float but there isn‚Äôt much float compared to the total number of shares. Outstanding shares is 5.8% of total, so 94.2% is held close. Could it be because the float is so small? Why is the float so small?

And what‚Äôs with their last earnings report being Q4 2022?? Did they get embarrassed and decide not to publish that anymore??

I‚Äôm new here so I assume I‚Äôm missing something. Are they on the verge of bankruptcy? Are they in a slump? Are we alone in the universe? Much to think about. "

1510,Preliminary Analysis UnitedHealth Inc. (NYSE:UNH),wallstreetbets,W. W. Grainger,22,32,08-04-2024 04:10:59,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1byon16/preliminary_analysis_unitedhealth_inc_nyseunh/,"**Disclaimers**: I am not a financial, tax, or legal advisor. This due diligence is made solely for fun/private usage, and should be considered as such. This ""DD"" is not meant to be considered as anything more than an opinion and should be teated as definitive proof of any future events. The information in this presentation is based upon any information supplied to me and reflects prevailing conditions and my views as of this date, of which are suspect to Change. My estimates should be regarded as preliminary and for illustrative purposes only. \*There bot, can't get me now.

1. **Market Perception**\- The Healthcare industry right now is suffering due to the hack on Change Healthcare by UnitedHealth and on medicare. My wife works in healthcare, and claims have not been paid where she works since 1/31. Earnings for all healthcare companies will be down due to the lack of money coming in from Change Healthcare, Medicare, etc. With COVID, we saw pharmaceuticals shoot up and healthcare as a whole shoot up due to the federal government paying a premium for a vaccine and giving money to cases billed under COVID. We have seen a reduction in different sectors, but this could be detrimental to a few companies that are affected by this hack.

[Important Info on Cyberattack](https://gridinsoft.com/blogs/unitedhealth-hack-6tb-data-leak/) - There is something fishy going on here. If the cybergroup- ALPV was paid a ransom of $22 million dollars, wouldn't this fiasco be over. I think the state department stopped the payment, and this is the reason this has yet to be resolved. 

[State Department offers $10 million reward for info on ALPV](https://uk.news.yahoo.com/state-department-offers-10-million-193557172.html?guccounter=1&guce_referrer=aHR0cHM6Ly9uZXdzLmdvb2dsZS5jb20v&guce_referrer_sig=AQAAAKZ0PkMf2v70DTz5pnbPMnU-HKXE0WEetRETWwIGuorARJkFDBkOGLY4YUV3-FbX-ELvJf3zl727cyEdumDkFP5McFa878Vl2GpuQHtT7MERvkwr-4EY164G7qwkGw1VXCaiFtvxGmDdKMbEbk7CIOk-bh6pdZUJeUUpN_wFZrMD) - We can deduce that they are actively pursuing this group, but has yet to be resolved.

[The Latest Reason why Healthcare stocks fell](https://www.thestreet.com/investing/stocks/humana-tumbles-unitedhealth-and-cvs-slide-on-medicare-advantage-hit)- the news is not covering this enough and I think Medicare advantage rates are not the reason for this movement that happened. 

**2.** UnitedHealth has been a leader in the U.S. Healthcare industry. We could see movement to other healthcare stocks that dealth with these hacks better or were not affected by this hack. I think they will rebound when this resolves and they get through their backlog of claims that have yet to be filed, but their Q1 earnings (4/16) will be affected as well as other companies that rely on insurance and were affected by the hack.

[Unusual Options Activity UNH](https://www.benzinga.com/insights/options/24/04/38069812/unitedhealth-group-unusual-options-activity)- If we look at the chart on down we can see the tremendous put options that were recently bought vs open interest. Someone knows something or has a big hunch they are going down.

**3.** Some alternatives to this stock- Elevance stock, which owns BlueCross BlueShield, went through a similar experience and came back strong to a stock price of 507.35. We could see movement of investors to this stock if earnings reports are abysmal. (More than likely will be) My personal opinion is that the healthcare industry as a whole is not doing good right now though, so we could see this across the board. 

[The Best Link](https://www.cnn.com/2024/02/28/tech/cyberattack-health-insurance-doctors-therapists/index.html)- $100 million per day lost by healthcare providers in an industry with not a lot of cash on hand. It is not sustainable, and something needs to be done or these providers could file for bankruptcy. Also, in this article, Elevance has severed ties with this company. Good move Elevance.

[Communications with Hack](https://www.wsj.com/articles/unitedhealth-grapples-with-communications-during-hack-crisis-b1dfccd8)- They are trying to change the narrative by getting providers to publicaly announce upbeat statements. Trying to save face, but it is not working.

**Bull Case**- They will get this resolved and go back to their normal self. Technicals show it is at support, so it has to go up.

**Bear Case**\- Earnings (4/16) will be terrible, and we break the support and large investors look to move their positions to more reputable companies that don't have ties with this hack or UNH. 

**My personal position**\- UNH $410 Put 5/3

**TLDR:** Buy UNH Puts

1515,DD on Zoetis (ZTS): risk reward looking attractive here??,wallstreetbets,Zoetis,17,5,18-04-2024 03:05:13,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1c6t21z/dd_on_zoetis_zts_risk_reward_looking_attractive/,"This is my first DD so please be gentleüòä

The recent plunge of ZTS was due to a WSJ article published on 04/12:

[https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6](https://www.wsj.com/health/pharma/dog-cat-arthritis-drugs-bcdddea6)

Quote: ""The FDA received more than 3,800 reports of side effects concerning the drugs through the end of last year. The European Medicines Agency has received more than 12,300 reports of side effects involving Librela and more than 7,700 for Solensia since 2021, when the drugs went on sale in Europe. The figures include reports from the U.S. and other countries outside of the European Union.""

But a 04/15 Morgan Stanley survey of 75 US vets found: ""Almost all respondents (98%) already prescribe or plan to prescribe ZTS' Librela (canine pain) and Solensia (feline pain) with over half naming Librela (63%) and/or Solensia (36%) as the most impactful new products. On recent concerns over Librela side effects,¬†*only 4% of practitioners are concerned enough to be deterred from prescribing Librela, 83% have some level of concern but still prescribe, and 13% are not at all concerned.*¬†""

Vet surveys done by JPM and BofA had very similar findings.

Critically, Librela & Solensia are prescription drugs so the vets opinions matter the most.

Also per Morgan Stanley:

* ""we estimate WW mAbs sales (Librela and Solensia) contribute $0.73 to our FY24 EPS (13% of total) and $1.01 to our FY25 EPS (16%)"" -- on the day of the WSJ story the stock plunged 7.8%, pricing in roughly 50% reduction of the mAbs sales already?? This overreaction is clearly not supported by the vet surveys.
* ""the implied valuation without all pain mAbs globally (a harsh assumption, but for analysis purposes), would be 27.6x FY25 at the current share price, still below its 10-year historical average of 29.2x, suggesting the stock may be overly punished.""

Lastly, let's look at the technical side. ZTS is currently at critical support levels on the weekly chart. If it continues to hold these levels, I think the risk reward from here will look very attractive!

1516,ZOETIS: Bird Flu Pandemic Moonshot Update,wallstreetbets,Zoetis,14,9,04-04-2024 19:04:23,https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/comments/1bvvn88/zoetis_bird_flu_pandemic_moonshot_update/,"A while ago, I posted DD indicating how the bird flu is spreading to cattle one and a half week ago. Link here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/B26U4skfzp

Two days ago, there was the first confirmed case of bird flu transferred to humans in the United States in Texas from the **same cattle that was infected** which I also posted about here: https://www.reddit.com/r/wallstreetbets/s/XAoXOErjvq

NOW, there are already scientists saying that a potential bird flu pandemic is on the horizon, where it could be **100x worse than COVID**: https://nypost.com/2024/04/04/us-news/bird-flu-pandemic-could-be-100-times-worse-than-covid-scientists-warn/amp/

This was all predicted one and a half week ago and you are watching these events unfold in real time. Again, Zoetis is a medical company in the business of creating vaccines for this very same disease. They‚Äôve had patents approved by the USDA for this very same purpose. They have a contract with the USDA for this very same virus: https://www.zoetisus.com/news-and-media/zoetis-receives-contract-award-to-supply-the-usdas-national-veterinary-stockpile

Get in before it‚Äôs too late.
